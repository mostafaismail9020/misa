This is not a subrepo anymore, it is part of the main repo.  The reason for this is twofold:
  - after yES rolls off the project there is no guarantee that the new partner that will come along has access to the subrepo
  - there was a need to customize the packaging script to adjust deployment needs as this is a not fully managed customer. Heritage is responsible for deployments
