                          ; ge-success-story   ;                ; "<p><strong>Partners from the ground up</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><em>From supplier to local manufacturer</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The partnership between Saudi Arabia and GE is one that dates back to the very early days of the modern Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. At the time of its unification in 1932, Saudi Arabia had little or no infrastructure, as well as few companies that could deliver mega-projects to international standards. In that context, major international contractors provided the Saudi government with reliable support for the construction of road, power and water networks, and helped service the Gulf&rsquo;s first oil operations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The history of Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s economic development and GE&rsquo;s scope of operations in the country shows a close correlation and presents one of the best examples of foreign investor partnership with a developing state. GE was one of the first international firms that supported the Kingdom&rsquo;s infrastructure development in the 1930s and is today one of the largest foreign investors in Saudi Arabia, with over 80 years of continued operations in the country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the 1930s, it was GE&rsquo;s frame gas turbines to be used in the Kingdom&rsquo;s first oil discovery, and just a few years later GE&rsquo;s power turbines contributed to the electrification of Makkah. In 1950, Saudi Aramco completed the world&rsquo;s longest oil pipeline linking eastern Saudi Arabia with the Mediterranean Sea. This 1,212km Trans-Arabian Pipeline employed GE&rsquo;s frame 3 gas turbines to power its pumping stations. In the 1960s, GE&rsquo;s frame 5 gas turbines were used in Riyadh&rsquo;s first power plant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the Kingdom&rsquo;s economy grew increasingly dependent on its oil resources, the Saudi government started to issue five year development plans in 1970, with economic diversification at its core. In parallel, GE&rsquo;s relations with Saudi Arabia started to evolve from being an external supplier to a local investor. In 1976, the company started some early stage industrial localisation by entering in a joint venture agreement with Tamimi Power and Industrial Group for the creation of Middle East Engineering Saudi Arabia, a facility in Dammam offering repair and overhaul services of GE&rsquo;s generation equipment in the region.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s initiatives to diversify the economy have gained a new impetus under Saudi Vision 2030 policies. More than ever, investors are evaluating major investment opportunities to partner with the government in the localisation of industrial and manufacturing operations &ndash; a necessary step to grow and diversify the Kingdom&rsquo;s economy, generate skilled jobs and promote long-term economic sustainability. Therefore, foreign investors to the Kingdom are asked to look at ways to grow the local non-oil industrial base and address traditional challenges faced by regional industries, such as nascent local value chains.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once again, GE&rsquo;s investment in the country responded well to the government&rsquo;s input and in 2012, GE launched the Project Kingdom investment plan. Aligning with the Saudi national agenda, the project aimed at developing a fully localised industrial ecosystem based on six main components: manufacturing and services, local supply base, research and development, training, talent development and workforce development.</p>
<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p><em>A stream of targeted investments</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2012, as part of Project Kingdom, GE committed to significant investments to back the country&rsquo;s plans in terms of localisation, economic diversification and innovation. The investment focused on three key areas: innovation and business development, health care and energy. In March 2015, additional new programmes were announced to further the company&rsquo;s localisation efforts, build research and innovation capacity, and create jobs in advanced manufacturing and software analytics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just one month after the launch of Saudi Vision 2030 in April 2016 by HRH Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, GE signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for $3bn worth of joint investments with Dussur, an investment initiative by Public Investment Fund, Saudi Aramco and SABIC to expand localised manufacturing in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In October 2016, several agreements were announced with key partners such as the Ministry of Health, Saudi Aramco, Saudi Electricity Company, Saudi Telecom Company and TAQNIA. These agreements focus on areas such as digitisation, asset performance management, optimisation and advanced cybersecurity solutions for industrial environments. Finally, on the occasion of President Donald Trump&rsquo;s visit to Saudi Arabia in May 2017, GE signed MoUs with Saudi partners valued at $15bn &ndash; across multiple sectors and partners aimed at creating a diverse and sustainable economic platform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>An advanced industrial center</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The investment initiatives undertaken by GE over the course of the past few decades have most notably led to the expansion and launch of two major global industrial hubs, namely: GE Manufacturing &amp; Technology Center (GEMTEC) and GE Saudi Advanced Turbines (GESAT), a joint venture between Dussur and GE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>GEMTEC is what best exemplifies the investor&rsquo;s bid to create a local industrial ecosystem. Beginning its operation in 2012, The 17,000-sq-metre facility &ndash; about three times the size of an American football field &ndash; employs more than 500 skilled workers and is the first comprehensive manufacturing ecosystem for the power and oil &amp; gas sector in the MENA region. It is also the largest GE gas turbine maintenance and repair facility in the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>GEMTEC has manufactured 12 gas compression trains for phase one of Saudi Aramco&rsquo;s Master Gas System expansion project in the Kingdom. The first gas compression train was delivered in January 2016. Six more gas compression trains, each with an aero-derivative gas turbine driving a centrifugal compressor were delivered in March 2017. The first &ldquo;Made in Saudi&rdquo; heavy-duty gas turbine was shipped in the December 2016. This 7FA.05 gas turbine was for the Waad al Shamal project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of additional commitments to invest in localised innovation in Saudi Arabia, GE opened the Hot &amp; Harsh Global Research &amp; Development Center at GEMTEC. The center focuses on the effects of high temperature, dust, corrosion, erosion, duty cycle and fuel harshness which have a critical impact on the reliability and efficiency of power plants in the MENA region. The center employs 25 researchers and 10 engineers and lab technicians. It has so far registered 10 patents, with another five patents under review. The findings from the current research will be deployed in the gas turbine manufacturing and repair facilities at GEMTEC and have potential applications in countries with similar environmental challenges as Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>GESAT was established in Dammam in June 2017 to manufacture heavy duty gas turbines and components in the Kingdom. The 9000-sq-metre facility manufactures 7FA.05 gas turbines and 7H gas turbine accessory modules, and exports them from Saudi Arabia to over 20 countries. GESAT is the only facility in the MENA region to manufacture hot gas path components for gas turbines. In 2018, GESAT will export two 9FA gas turbines to Bangladesh, complete with new advanced gas path upgrades.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of the Project Kingdom investments announced in 2012, combined both facilities today manufacture and repair H-class gas turbines, which the company describes as the world&rsquo;s largest and most efficient of their kind, as well as the latest gas turbine technology available globally.</p>
<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p><em>A sustainable industrial ecosystem</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>The investment made by GE to create a local industrial ecosystem has pursued two main objectives. First, it enhances GE&rsquo;s competitiveness in a G20 market and supports the local investment&rsquo;s sustainability in the long term. Second, it impacts a number of economic indicators that are central to the Kingdom&rsquo;s Vision 2030 policies. Among the key targets for 2030 the Kingdom aims to:</p>
<ul>
<li>lower national unemployment from 11.6% to 7%</li>
<li>increase small and medium-sized enterprises&rsquo; (SMEs) contribution to GDP from 20% to 35%</li>
<li>increase women&rsquo;s participation in the workforce from 22% to 30%</li>
<li>increase the localisation of the oil and gas sector from 40% to 75%</li>
<li>increase foreign direct investment from 3.8% to 5.7% of GDP</li>
<li>raise the share of non-oil exports in non-oil GDP from 16% to 50%</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The success of GE&rsquo;s investment partnership with Saudi Arabia is once again based on the company&rsquo;s strategic alignment to these goals, and its impact is best described by some key milestones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently, GE employs over 4000 skilled workers in Saudi Arabia active across its primary businesses: aviation, power, health care, and in oilfield services through its recent acquisition of Baker Hughes, a GE company. Of these, 50% are Saudi professionals. GESAT and GEMTEC score higher than average in terms of employment of Saudi nationals, with a 55% and 70% rate, respectively. In addition, in 2014 GE inaugurated the All-Women Business Process Outsourcing Center &amp; Digital Hub in partnership with Saudi Aramco and Tata Consulting Services. The center provides services in finance and accounting, human resources, supply chain, linguistics and digital technology. As of early 2018, the facility employed over 1000 women, of whom 85% are Saudi professionals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2013 GE and the Saudi Aramco Entrepreneurship Center (Wa&rsquo;ed) signed an agreement to support SMEs. The purpose of the partnership is to encourage Saudi SMEs to be active in the domestic manufacturing and services sector. Through this initiative, GE provided local suppliers with training and development on the latest technologies and provided them with the opportunity to become a global supplier and join GE&rsquo;s global supply chain. As of February 2018 GE has over 2000 Saudi suppliers across all categories, with more than 150 &lsquo;advanced&rsquo; Saudi SMEs suppliers being a part of the GE manufacturing ecosystem. The company aims to raise the number of &lsquo;advanced&rsquo; SMEs suppliers to 300 by 2020.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In June 2016, GE held a Global Supplier Forum in Riyadh. The purpose of the forum was to encourage GE global suppliers to either establish or increase their presence in Saudi Arabia. The forum also encouraged local suppliers to network with GE&rsquo;s global suppliers, hence becoming part of a global supply chain. In partnership with the Saudi Industrial Property Authority and SAGIA, the forum convened more than 500 partners and suppliers from more than 20 countries. After the Global Supplier Forum, 40% of the international customers and SMEs said they are interested in investing in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks to the establishment of the GEMTEC and GESAT manufacturing facilities, GE in Saudi Arabia exports parts and services to more than 70 customers in 40 countries across the Middle East, Europe, Africa and the US, generating over $100m in exports. Additionally, the All-Women Business Process Outsourcing Center &amp; Digital Hub currently serves more than 55 countries.<strong><br /></strong></p>

<h3><strong>CEO Interview&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p><em>Hisham Al Bahkali, President, GE Saudi Arabia</em></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>How would you describe GE&rsquo;s overall experience as a foreign investor in Saudi Arabia?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>GE&rsquo;s experience as a foreign investor in Saudi Arabia has not only been successful but has exceeded expectations to a great extent. GE has been present in Saudi Arabia for over 80 years, mostly working in infrastructure development. However, the encouragement we have received from the Saudi government since 2012 has incentivised GE to shift investment towards developing several elements of the local ecosystem that support sustainability and diversification of the Saudi economy. A company like GE, with shareholders to report to, would not have entered into such a set of major investments had it not believed in the Kingdom&rsquo;s vision and competitiveness as a global hub.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company has received tremendous support from government partners like SAGIA and major customers, such as Saudi Aramco, SABIC, Saudi Electricity Company and Saudi Airlines. Even more importantly, GE strategically decided to further leverage Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s competitive advantages: a young talent pool, the country&rsquo;s commitment to an open economy and its location between three continents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How competitive are Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s investment incentives at a global level?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite the long-standing attractiveness of low input and utility costs, Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s competitiveness has for many years been constrained by bureaucracy and red tape. Saudi Vision 2030 is removing barriers to foreign investment at an unprecedented pace in the Kingdom. Most procedures that used to take one month can now be completed in two to three days. Anything that used to take several days to process can now be done in one click. These not only include SAGIA&rsquo;s investor licence process, but also Customs clearance, visa procedures, airport services and tax payment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even in the current economic environment, where the government is introducing new fiscal measures leading to a more sustainable economic and development path, the cost of doing business in Saudi Arabia remains very low by international standards. Land prices in industrial and economic cities are extremely competitive and measures to cut red tape are eliminating additional hidden costs we accounted for in the past. The change to today&rsquo;s new environment is apparent for those of us who have been investing in Saudi for a long time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What prompted the decision to establish a local industrial hub of the magnitude of GEMTEC?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In terms of significance, GEMTEC is not just another factory for either GE or Saudi Arabia. GEMTEC is GE&rsquo;s largest maintenance and repair facility worldwide and the Middle East&rsquo;s first comprehensive manufacturing ecosystem for the power and oil and gas sectors. It is endowed with advanced technology in terms of maintenance, repair and manufacturing. We are using it as a hub for export to over 40 countries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s strategic location, other conditions have emerged in recent years to incentivise the establishment of such a facility. Firstly, Saudi Arabia enjoys very favorable demographics. We decided to heavily invest in Saudi youth and trained our staff in field services. Our Saudi professionals are now completing service assignments across the globe and contributing to enhancing the Saudi country brand abroad. On top of that, GE has invested in the right technology. Previously, machinery from the Middle East would be shipped all the way to the US for repair and maintenance services. Today, our Saudi-based facilities have made this practice less desirable from a shipping and efficiency perspectives. The technology we installed at GEMTEC is, in some areas, even more advanced than GE&rsquo;s counterpart facilities located in the US.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>The absence of a strong value chain is often seen as a challenge to the growth of local industrial capacity. In what ways have you tackled this?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have had increased focus since we announced our partnership in 2012 with the Saudi Aramco Entrepreneurship Center (Wa&rsquo;ed) with the aim to engage SMEs in the domestic manufacturing and service sector. Today we are strategically supporting the local SME value chain in two ways.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, through the Global Supplier Forum, we invited between 200 and 300 of our GE global suppliers to visit Saudi Arabia. We introduced them to major local companies and in partnership with MODON, we took them on a tour of Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s industrial facilities. By showing the success of GE in Saudi Arabia, we encouraged them to pursue the same path by teaming up with local SMEs and to become GE&rsquo;s local suppliers. Around 40% of those companies have expressed their intention to invest in the Kingdom and some are now in the process of completing the necessary procedures with the government&rsquo;s authorities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, a few years ago we saw the need to strengthen the local value chain and empower Saudi SMEs, so we increasingly began sourcing products locally. We are reaching out to the SMEs already established in Saudi Arabia and helping them to become a qualified GE supplier, which enhances their global competitiveness. In 2016, 29% of the gas turbine systems at GEMTEC were made and supplied by Saudi-based SMEs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What strategies has GE adopted for the training of Saudi staff?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Multinational companies like GE are always looking for the best talent. To this end, we have been working with the best universities locally, including King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM) and King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST). We keep close relations with top universities in the US and UK to monitor their pool of Saudi graduates. We built scholarship programmes with KFUPM, and since 2015 SAGIA has provided us with incentives to hire around 35 engineers graduating from US universities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have also established programmes that relate to female employment. Among these is the Saudi Women Development Forum, which is a three-day workshop that has been held for the past few years to improve the skillsets and leadership capabilities of female employees in a wide range of areas including in operations and human resources. At GE we invested in Saudi female professionals in areas such as finance, auditing and legal. We started hiring females in 2010, but at that time you would never see women in executive and senior executive positions. It is a major achievement that today we have Saudi women executives leading large pools of male and female staff in an industrial hub like GEMTEC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What recommendations would you give to prospective investors looking to localise operations in Saudi?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Companies that are new to Saudi Arabia mostly lack information about the market. This is our first impression when we interact with our global network of suppliers. I would encourage prospective investors to go through the sectors prioritised by Saudi Vision 2030, such as mining, entertainment, military and logistics. There are strong incentives and support for companies willing to invest in these sectors. I recommend focusing on the Saudi Vision 2030 mandate and learning the best way to approach local regulations, customers and potential partners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The government of Saudi Arabia regularly organises missions to meet local authorities and CEOs of major local companies. I have actively participated in these events and they are excellent opportunities for prospective investors to get introduced to the local market. There are several qualification requirements with local customers such as Saudi Aramco, SABIC, Saudi Electricity Company or Ma&rsquo;aden. The new overseas offices to be established by SAGIA or the International Center for Strategic Partnerships can play an even more crucial role in streamlining some of these requirements.</p> "

                          ; hyundai-success-story ;                ; "<p><strong>The world&rsquo;s largest maritime industrial complex</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><em>A story of three actors</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The global shipbuilding industry has had a challenging few years on the back of a worldwide contraction in trade volumes and a consequent decline in demand for commodity ships and offshore vessels. With global macroeconomic prospects improving in the near term, the industry is also expected to rebound in 2018.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this context, South Korea, the world&rsquo;s largest shipbuilding nation, and Saudi Arabia, the world&rsquo;s largest oil-exporting nation, reached an agreement in 2017 to take their long-standing business relationship to the next level. The story of this renewed investment commitment features three main actors with a deeply rooted business partnership &ndash; Saudi Aramco, the National Shipping Company of Saudi Arabia (Bahri) and Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia has been exporting oil for almost 80 years. The first tanker load of Saudi crude oil was exported in 1939 on board of the&nbsp;<em>D.G. Scofield</em>, a ship that carried less than one-twentieth of a modern oil tanker&rsquo;s load. Today Saudi Arabia has grown to be the world&rsquo;s largest oil exporter, accounting for roughly 18% of global oil exports in 2016.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To serve Saudi Aramco&rsquo;s captive market, Bahri was established by the Saudi government in 1978 to support the Kingdom&rsquo;s crude oil export growth. The flag carrier has progressively diversified beyond oil barges to add the shipping capacity for chemicals, dry bulk and multi-purpose cargo. Today, Bahri has a fleet of 90 vessels, of which 43 are Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs). This makes Bahri the world&rsquo;s largest owner and operator of VLCCs, with a total of 11.6m of deadweight tonnage (DWT).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the past decades, 34 of Bahri&rsquo;s vessels were supplied by our third actor, Korea-based HHI. HHI started fabricating vessels in 1972, while HHI&rsquo;s offshore structures unit commenced in 1976, when the yard received an order from Saudi Arabia for the fabrication of 89 jackets and offshore structures to serve Jubail&rsquo;s industrial projects, in the Kingdom&rsquo;s eastern region. Over the years, HHI has grown to become the world&rsquo;s largest shipbuilding company and to operate the world&rsquo;s largest offshore yard. With its only shipyard facilities located in Ulsan, South Korea, HHI has a global market share of approximately 10% and a total production capacity of 200m DWT in 2017.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Seizing the opportunity</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2016 Saudi Arabia launched its Vision 2030 plan to overhaul the economy, reduce its dependence on oil resources and localize value-added components of the supply chain across all sectors. As a key Vision 2030 driver, Saudi Arabia is aiming to build local industrial capacity for major imported items, including military equipment and automotive vehicles, as well as oil rigs and shipping vessels. The Vision&rsquo;s launch provided the spark for our story to begin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Kingdom&rsquo;s national oil company, Saudi Aramco, for decades hired offshore vessels and oil rigs from third-party suppliers such as HHI to service its operations. In line with its vertical integration strategic approach, however, and in line with Vision 2030 targets, Aramco is now taking steps to expand into offshore services and operations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the one hand, Vision 2030 represented the perfect ground for Saudi Aramco and Bahri to incentivize a closer relationship with a main global supplier such as HHI. On the other hand, Vision 2030&rsquo;s investment incentives provided HHI with the opportunity to stay ahead of competitors during a global industry slowdown, strengthen relationships with major customers and expand its shipbuilding capacity beyond the Ulsan shipyard.</p>
<p>These factors led to the December 2017 Saudi Aramco, Bahri, HHI and UAE-based engineering company Lamprell signing of an agreement to jointly create, develop and operate a $5.2bn integrated maritime yard, the International Maritime Industries (IMI) at the King Salman International Complex for Maritime Industries in Ras Al Khair, on the eastern coast of Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The nearly 12m-square-metre IMI facility will be the largest in the region in terms of scale and capacity. As the anchor project of the maritime complex, IMI will supply Saudi Aramco and Bahri with an impressive mix of products and maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) services. At full capacity the yard will be able to deliver 40 vessels, including three VLCCs, and four offshore rigs, as well as service over 260 maritime products each year. With the first products expected to roll out from IMI in 2019, the yard will reach full capacity in 2022.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 60-year joint venture contract is targeting both local and global demand. Locally, IMI has stipulated off-take agreements with both Saudi Aramco and Bahri. Around 50% of the IMI&rsquo;s rig fabrication capacity will be allocated to Saudi Aramco, while 30% of the shipbuilding capacity will be purchased by Bahri. The localization of MRO services, oil rigs and vessels will help the two Saudi shareholders to optimize costs, demand specifications and increase overall efficiency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The remaining production capacity &ndash; 50% of oil rigs and 70% of shipbuilding &ndash; will be used by the Korean shipbuilding giant to serve the global market through its existing sales network. Given its strong shareholder base and competitive location, IMI will be competing with regional yards in the UAE and Bahrain, as well as Asian producers, which have dominated the market in the past decades.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IMI represents the first shipyard beyond the Korean national borders to which HHI has ever provided investment capital and technical support. With this investment, HHI will be able to benefit from Saudi Aramco&rsquo;s pulling power to quickly scale up, capture more of the global market and influence market forces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>The wider impact</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HHI&rsquo;s investment and the broader King Salman International Complex for Maritime Industries fulfill many of the key elements of Vision 2030 and the In-Kingdom Total Value Add (IKTVA) program. The latter is a program launched by Saudi Aramco in 2015 to increase its local procurement ratios and support the growth of Saudi-based contractors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a high-level goal, Vision 2030 aims to grow Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s economy from being the 19th-largest global economy to enter the top 15 by 2030. The maritime complex in Ras Al Khair, of which IMI will be the anchor tenant, is expected to contribute $17bn to the Kingdom&rsquo;s GDP, of which $12bn is expected to come from the import substitution of maritime products and services. Localization is arguably the most important factor contributing to this goal. Vision 2030 aims to increase the localization of the oil and gas sector from 40% to 75% by 2030. Through its IKTVA targets, Saudi Aramco is expecting to contribute by achieving 70% localization of all spending by 2021.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The IMI joint venture investment with HHI will play an important part towards meeting the localization goal. The shipyard is aiming to utilize 60% local content by 2020 and 80% by 2030. This will mostly involve tapping into and potentially expanding the local steel value chain, as steel products are expected to contribute to approximately 90% of the shipyard&rsquo;s raw materials. In smaller amounts, the shipyard activities will require the provision of bronze and aluminum supplies. The localization of IMI&rsquo;s procurement is therefore expected to create further investment opportunities in the steel, bronze and aluminum value chain in the Ras Al Khair industrial complex.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vision 2030 aims to lower the rate of unemployment from 11.6% to 7% by 2030, with Saudi Aramco&rsquo;s IKTVA program contributing to the indirect employment of 500,000 new hires by 2021. The Ras Al Khair complex by itself is expected to create more than 80,000 direct and indirect jobs by 2030. As part of this goal, the HHI-backed yard is planning to employ 6,000 people by 2020, of which 27% will be Saudi, and 15,000 employees by 2030, with a 51% Saudiization rate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of the investment and technical support agreement, HHI is expected to begin with a heavy presence of Korean foremen at the complex and gradually hand over operations to Saudi staff. In parallel, the newly established National Maritime Academy (NMA) in Ras Al Khair will be providing Saudi professionals with training in the skills demanded by the maritime and shipbuilding industry. The NMA will initially train 1,400 students per year, and later expand capacity to 2,000 students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, Vision 2030 initiatives are expected to raise the share of non-oil exports from 16% to 50% of non-oil GDP. As part of the IMI&rsquo;s off-take agreements, the new shipyard will export 50% of its oil rigs and 70% of its shipbuilding production capacity. At full capacity, that should consist of two offshore oil rigs and approximately 28 vessels targeting the global market.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In conclusion, HHI&rsquo;s recent investment in Saudi Arabia provides a case study of how a long-term trading partnership in the global oil export value chain was able to find in Vision 2030 the right platform to evolve. HHI, along with Saudi Aramco and Bahri, were able to seize the opportunity to strengthen their relationship while pursuing an aggressive growth strategy during a worldwide industry downturn.</p>

                          ; total-success-story ;                ; "<p><strong>Knowledge transfer through a strong partnership</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Rapid entry</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Total first invested in Saudi Arabia through a 2007 joint venture with Zahid Group for lubricants and special fluids activities, Saudi Total Petroleum Products, a first successful partnership in Saudi Arabia. Just one year later in 2008, Total and Saudi Aramco decided&nbsp;to create the Saudi Aramco Total Refining and Petrochemical (SATORP) joint venture in order to build, in Jubail, one of the world&rsquo;s most efficient refineries.<br /><br />SATORP was fully operational by 2014. Among the world&rsquo;s largest refining and petrochemicals platforms, it produces a wide range of&nbsp;<strong>high-value-added refined&nbsp;</strong>products: liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), naphtha, gasoline, jet fuel, diesel and petroleum coke as well as petrochemical products: benzene, propylene and paraxylene.</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>SATORP makes up one of Saudi Aramco&rsquo;s first forays into the downstream petrochemical business. Total saw the advantages of securing a reliable crude oil supply on a large scale, something Aramco could provide at a level above any other oil producer on the globe, controlling a fifth of the world&rsquo;s proven oil reserves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Major alliance</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>The creation of SATORP brought together two giants &ndash; oil majors from the international top class. Together they formed a strong relationship which involved transferring downstream and petrochemical know-how from Total to Aramco, while at the same time Aramco was able to guide Total on how to invest in the local market, including how to best hire and train Saudi staff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SATORP&rsquo;s integrated petrochemical activities marked a first for Aramco and Saudi Arabia, and unlock new possibilities for downstream processing. Propylene and benzene are sold to local converters which take these products and further process them into specialty chemicals that can be used in manufacturing and other industries. So far, SATORP&rsquo;s paraxylene production is being exported, although it is working with Saudi Aramco and other actors to seek new opportunities for paraxylene use within the Kingdom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SATORP was also the Kingdom&rsquo;s first producer of petroleum coke, coming on-line one year before YASREF, a fellow refinery on the west coast of the Kingdom. By investing in a coking unit, SATORP was able to convert conventional heavy fuel oil from the refining process into high value gasoline and diesel, and into petroleum coke, which is exported for use in power generation and cement production.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In liquid fuels, SATORP again took the extra step already at design stage in 2008, to make sure all of its products meet the highest international specifications. Producing ultra-low-sulfur jet fuel, gasoline and diesel opens the door to all of the European, American and Asian markets where the most rigorous specifications are applied. Having this flexibility enables the company to take advantage of seasonal shifts in driving, heating and other habits. As the UN International Maritime Organization implements its legislation on marine fuel oil, or bunker, low-sulfur fuels, prices are also expected to rise in 2020. Low-sulfur diesel-related products will be in higher demand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Returning the favor</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Four years after the plant&rsquo;s start up, 70% of SATORP&rsquo;s employees are Saudi nationals, and the company continues to work for more. SATORP has been in the advantageous position of having both Saudi Aramco and Total&rsquo;s expertise at its fingertips. The relationship between Total and Saudi Aramco is a global partnership that features exceptional expertise in the field of refining and petrochemicals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the early days, technical expertise largely came from Total, but since start-up, most of these positions have been permanently handed over to Saudi nationals. In order to achieve this target, Saudi Aramco and Total, trained nearly 400 Saudis to be plant operators with on-site training in a dedicated SATORP training center. Another 28 Saudi engineers completed their studies in France through a partnership with Institut Fran&ccedil;ais du P&eacute;trole - &Eacute;nergies Nouvelles, the French Institute of Petroleum. In a similar vein, 25% of all material procurement costs were provided by Saudi companies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Global automated powerhouse</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SATORP now has 1066 employees running a sophisticated and highly-automated complex. As Saudi Arabia aims to incentivize the adoption by local manufacturers of Industry 4.0 systems &ndash; i.e. connected devices and automation - Saudi refineries have led the way with the most advanced multivariable controls. This consists of capturing live data and optimizing the refinery on a second-by-second basis; whereas a human operator can examine up to a dozen data points at the same time, a multivariable control can track hundreds of indicators.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With computers measuring and analyzing every step of the operations, to optimize the processes and keep the products as close to the specifications as possible, SATORP was able to minimize incidence of human error. This in turn allowed SATORP to increase capacity from 400,000 up to 440,000 barrels per day without additional fixed-cost spending.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After developing a quality local ecosystem and building national expertise, SATORP serves as a model for Saudi industry overall. In addition, thanks to the strong partnership with Total, Saudi Aramco continues to develop local skills by developing further downstream activities in line with the goals set out by Vision 2030.</p>

<h3><strong>CEO Interview</strong></h3>
<p><em>Beno&icirc;t Chagu&eacute;, Managing Director of Total Refining &amp; Chemicals and Total Country Chair in KSA</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What is the biggest advantage for the refinery being based in Saudi Arabia?</strong></p>
<p>Although the oil market is a global one, location counts. Being next to Aramco&rsquo;s production means that the pipelines run right outside of our fence and crude oil is delivered to our gate dependably and reliably. Unlike many refineries around the world that have to buy their oil on the market, our Saudi refinery was tailored to the local heavy crude coming from the largest oil fields in the world. Having one feedstock allows for stability and optimization without having excess capacities on the units. Refineries that buy from market have to construct large tank farms to secure their own supply, but more importantly they have to continuously adjust their processes to ensure that their products meet certain standards despite having different sources of feedstock.</p>
<p><br />By simply using the latest state-of-the-art equipment available and optimizing our internal processes, we were able to boost production from 400,000 to 440,000 barrels per day. Due to economies of scale, we cut the processing cost of every barrel of crude oil that we refine at SATORP. On the other side, Saudi Aramco is building a trucking facility to incentivize sales to the local market. SATORP is also producing petrochemical products which allow the Kingdom to supply more local converters and manufacturers, our customers. An utmost advantage is obviously the quality of our partner Saudi Aramco, both for the quality of its management and workforce in developing new projects and for its ability to work as one team in our partnership.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Have you identified any possible future expansions for SATORP?</strong></p>
<p>We are currently studying projects for future expansions with further debottlenecking of the refinery and also by working with both current and potential future partners for SATORP downstream development. This will be in the petrochemical space, a growing field in the Kingdom and in the region overall, as demand for both basic and specialty petrochemical products continues to rise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How would you rate the capabilities of the Saudi talent you have encountered since entering the Kingdom?</strong></p>
<p>We have been impressed by the quality and skills of the Saudi workforce. The Kingdom has excellent universities and training programs abroad and, through Saudi Aramco, it provides huge support to international partners that are looking to invest here. Management skills in particular have been impressive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In terms of capacity building, the speed and scale of Saudi Aramco&rsquo;s downstream developments in the last five years are incomparable. All of their plants are world-class units despite being newcomers to the industry. Naturally, achieving so much at such a rapid speed needs strong international partnership and expertise, but these skills are quickly transferred to Saudis. Overall, Saudi Aramco&rsquo;s biggest strength is in finding the right partners and creating the right deal to make all parties committed to keep investing locally. Although our Saudization rate in SATORP is already at 70%, we see it as a duty to increase it further and will continue to work on that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ecosystem of local contractors and service providers is also to world-class standards. We have just completed our first turnaround now; this is the time when the plant partially shuts down as we perform maintenance on the equipment. Throughout this process we have had the opportunity to hire local companies and were again impressed by the local capacities that the Kingdom had built up as a refining country. The reliability of the facility depends on both the operation and the quality of the maintenance and this first turnaround was a very positive experience in all aspects: a high quality job was done, with an excellent safety record and within budget and timing. More than 1.2m ManHours were worked and there was a peak of 4500 people on site during the turnaround.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What investment opportunities in Saudi Arabia do you see as the most promising?</strong></p>
<p>Investors should focus on the industrial clusters as opportunities. Through the National Industrial Cluster Development Program, the government has already done all of the necessary feasibility studies that highlight where Saudi Arabia can excel and what potential exists. These clusters include chemicals, mining and metals, pharmaceuticals and automotive manufacturing, in addition to others. Government support also makes them the most promising investments possible given the current climate, available resources and designated land. International companies that can form strong local partnerships with customers and suppliers should seize the opportunity. Through the cluster program investors can benefit from the best access to both suppliers and the growing regional market. In our experience, forming an equal partnership has been the optimal approach; our subsidiaries have managed to be successful thanks to the support they received from both Total and our Saudi partners.</p> "

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Grounded with an enduring partnership</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The successful relationship between Siemens and Saudi Arabia has historic roots.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Werner von Siemens, Siemens founder, was the first to lead a team that laid telegraphic cables under the Red Sea; at a time when the region had little infrastructure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was followed by the firm&rsquo;s very first official business transaction in the early 1930s, when visionary local businessmen imported and subsequently installed power-generation equipment. It was this initial investment that paved the way for the advanced power infrastructure that is found today in the Kingdom.</p>
<p>In the 1950s Siemens established some core developments which truly helped set the stage for its future impact in the country. Due to a rapidly growing customer base, by 1952 the company sent its first resident engineer to Saudi Arabia. Two years later came many significant milestones, including the first phone call in Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s history by King Saud via the use of Siemens technology, which paved the way for the Kingdom&rsquo;s first telecommunications network installation by Siemens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>New hub redefines local manufacturing</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia approaches a new wave of industrialization and localization policies under the helm of Vision 2030, Siemens has also committed to expand and diversify its local investment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Siemens Dammam Energy Hub (SDEH), established in 2014, is the company&rsquo;s flag-ship production facility in Saudi Arabia. The SDEH is the first gas-turbine facility of its kind in the country and is the largest in the Middle East. In 2016, the first &ldquo;Made in KSA&rdquo; gas turbine was launched. This was a historic milestone, and Siemens took pride in this turbine being built in Saudi Arabia, for Saudi Arabia and by Saudi Arabian talent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Siemens also received the Saudi Water and Electricity Forum (SWEF) Award, which further emphasizes the strength of its relationship with local partners. With the capacity to build up to 10 turbines annually, the SDEH showcases the firm&rsquo;s use of cutting-edge technologies and the development of local capabilities to produce highly efficient engineering masterpieces. Siemens is also continuing to develop local supply chains, along with its strong commitment to increasing innovation and industrialization in line with Vision 2030.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Training initiatives and knowledge transfer</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SDEH also highlights Siemens&rsquo; continuously expanding local footprint in Saudi Arabia. The project, however, also required addressing some of the challenges that comes along with staffing and transferring knowledge to a facility of such proportions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the beginning of the project, Siemens launched a massive training program for local talent, in partnership with the Saudi Petroleum Services Polytechnic (SPSP), an initiative overseen by the Ministry of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources and the Technical and Vocational Training Corporation &ndash; the government&rsquo;s vocational training arm. As a result, by the end of 2016, newly qualified Saudi Arabian gas-turbine experts built the first of six F-class gas turbines for Saudi Aramco&rsquo;s integrated gasification combined-cycle power plant in Jazan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides those related to the SDEH, Siemens is also investing in its partnerships with academic institutions. The company recently announced a &euro;100m investment in industrial software for universities aiming to build up the most advanced local digital capabilities, and to prepare Saudi Arabian students and future leaders for the &ldquo;fourth&rdquo; industrial revolution. This industrial software includes digital twinning capabilities for integrated design, engineering and manufacturing. It will also facilitate next-level industrial research and capacity build-up. Effat University and King Saud University have already received the software, and it is currently being introduced at other universities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Siemens has also been working with multiple institutes, including the Siemens developed a vocational training concept modeled around the German dual system, in partnership with Colleges of Excellence. The concept was implemented in October 2017 with the intake of the first local students starting their Rail Technician training at the Saudi Railway Polytechnic in Qassim. In addition, the dual approach is being implemented with Business Administration trainees at Siemens sites across the Kingdom, the majority of whom are local female talent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>A local impact</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In terms of helping achieve Vision 2030 goals, Siemens has taken a very unique approach. By co-creating and working with a number of public and private customers, including Saudi Aramco, Saudi Electricity Company and the Saline Water Conversion Corporation, Siemens was able to identify crucial issues for the Kingdom. Despite being a foreign investor, Siemens took pride in considering itself as having the same characteristics as if it was inherently a Saudi company. This mentality is what helped the company to achieve significant results in terms of economic growth, development of human capital, environmental protection, quality of life and overall transformation of the society.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By actively electrifying, automating, digitizing and innovating, Siemens&rsquo; investments will have a direct or indirect impact on several key Vision 2030 targets such as:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase women&rsquo;s participation in the workforce from 22% to 30%;</li>
<li>Increase small and medium-sized enterprises&rsquo; (SMEs) contribution to GDP from 20% to 35%;</li>
<li>Increase foreign direct investment from 3.8% to 5.7% of GDP;</li>
<li>Increase the private sector&rsquo;s contribution from 40% to 65% of GDP; and</li>
<li>Lower national unemployment from 11.6% to 7%.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vision 2030 is also working towards having three Saudi cities ranked in the top-100 cities in the world. In its November 2016 &ldquo;Smart Cities Saudi Arabia&rdquo; report, Siemens featured a comprehensive analysis of some specific challenges and technological opportunities within the main Saudi cities. In the capital city of Riyadh, for instance, by equipping Lines 1 and 2 of the Riyadh Metro with energy-efficient and driverless inspiro metro trains, Siemens is addressing two key challenges &ndash; unhealthy levels of air pollution and unsafe roads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The case of Siemens, a company that has established and maintained a strong local partnership in the Kingdom, can be seen as a best practice for modeling profitable relationships between foreign investors and local stakeholders leading towards achieving the goals of Vision 2030.<strong><br /></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>CEO Interview</strong></h3>
<p><em>Arja Talakar, CEO, Siemens Saudi Arabia</em></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>How would you describe Siemens&rsquo; overall experience as foreign investor since its Saudi market entry?</strong></p>
<p>Since the installation of Siemens power-generation equipment in the Kingdom and our partnership with E.A. Juffali &amp; Brothers, we have been here, every step of the way, co-creating with Saudi Arabia. To be honest, it doesn&rsquo;t feel as if we are &ldquo;foreign investors&rdquo; in Saudi Arabia. We consider Saudi Arabia home. From the outset, we have worked directly with a host of public and private customers and have developed a great partnership with the Kingdom, whether in terms of expanding our presence, focusing on localization, setting up our Siemens Dammam Energy Hub and partnering on the path of electrification, automation and increasingly, digitalization.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>What challenges has Siemens traditionally faced while navigating the regulatory environment?</strong></p>
<p>Every market has its own challenges and the Saudi market is no exception. However, many of the challenges an investor faced &ndash; let&rsquo;s say in the 1990s &ndash; were addressed by setting up SAGIA, the Kingdom&rsquo;s investment promotion agency. We are going through what is the foundation for an even brighter Saudi Arabia. Vision 2030 is a great roadmap, which I am confident will succeed and flourish with the right regulatory environment and investment-friendly policies. We are very confident in the prosperity and economic development of the Kingdom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this context, localization is extremely important for investors, not only for creating employment but also for adding economic value through manufacturing and supply-chain development. Investment in manufacturing industries requires a longer-term market view, and localization will be a vital element to ensure sustainable development of the local industries. We believe that the Kingdom has the potential to become a regional manufacturing hub and an industrial heavyweight. Global best practices prove that creating &ldquo;champions&rdquo; in strategic industries through active support is a better alternative than a project-by-project approach and that is what the Kingdom is trying to achieve.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s your perspective on the investment incentives provided by Saudi Arabia to investors like Siemens?</strong></p>
<p>For us, the biggest reason to consider investing further in Saudi Arabia is the attractiveness of the market. With a solid domestic market and the creation of champions, Saudi Arabia is progressing on the path towards becoming an export-centric nation. Even geographically, Saudi Arabia is ideally located, with easy access to European, Asian and African markets. New regulations providing more incentives for companies willing to invest in the country are coming up, and previously strict requirements are being removed.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Given the growth of local value chains and SME ecosystems, what opportunities do you see for collaboration with prospective investors?</strong></p>
<p>Under Saudi Vision 2030, the Kingdom plans to raise the contribution of SMEs from currently 20% of GDP to 35%. It is true that a strong SME value chain is a great enabler, not just for overall economic development, but also for large-scale industries. We believe that the strong value chain of SMEs is essential for developing the industry in Saudi Arabia. Therefore, more than half of our procurement value goes towards SMEs. We are moving in the right direction and our local SME supplier base is growing.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>In what areas can collaboration between investors and academia strengthen local R&amp;D capabilities?</strong></p>
<p>We believe that partnership between academia and industry is imperative for research and capacity build-up. Siemens is very mindful of the fact that investing in our partnership with universities will pay long-term dividends for the country overall while benefiting the industry in the process. And, while we think that investment in partnerships with universities is extremely important, another area that also needs to be focused on is technical and vocational training. For example, Germany is renowned for its dual education system, and together with our partners we developed and implemented this in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>What approach has Siemens adopted for the training of Saudi staff?</strong></p>
<p>Once a person joins Siemens, there is a whole range of training options available. Being a company focused on digitalization means new technologies and information pours in everyday and it is imperative that we stay up to date. We have a huge Siemens knowledge pool to tap into. We also conduct a lot of local and international trainings to support the development and growth of our employees. Additionally, all the vocational trainings and university programs that we work on through partnerships contribute to skill development. Developing the right skill set is one of the first and most important steps for sustainable development.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>What strategic recommendations would you give to prospective investors?</strong></p>
<p>Vision 2030 and the push to diversify the economy will create immense opportunities. This is the time for investors to come in and I think there is no better blueprint to guide them towards potential growth sectors than the Vision 2030. Entertainment and tourism is set to grow, the service sectors are going to develop further and, of course, technology and industrialization will be at the heart of the economy of Saudi Arabia.</p> "

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Leveraging a longstanding relationship</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Driven by a growing population, increasing per capita GDP and the rising incidence of non-communicable diseases, Saudi Arabia has in recent decades grown to become the largest pharmaceuticals market in the GCC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More recently, the Kingdom has evolved further from being a profitable market for global companies to a competitive location for the manufacturing of pharmaceutical products. With the launch of Vision 2030, the Kingdom&rsquo;s blueprint for economic development and diversification, the local pharmaceutical sector is expected to receive an even greater boost, having been identified by the government as a major prospective contributor to non-oil GDP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pfizer, the global pharmaceutical giant, has a longstanding relationship with Saudi Arabia dating back to 1960. The country is one of the main markets in Africa and the Middle East for the company. Over the last half century, Pfizer has brought a range of services and products to patients in the Kingdom. This includes a diverse portfolio of pharmaceuticals covering treatment areas including oncology, cardiovascular disease, pain, pediatric vaccinations, anti-fungal and antibacterial products, anesthesia, and critical care. The company also maintains a unique position in the market in offering a range of biological products such as vaccines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, over the course of its long relationship with Saudi Arabia, Pfizer has not simply confined itself to distributing products in the market. It has furthered and deepened commitment to Saudi patients, and its impact through a number of initiatives including promoting health, raising awareness of various disease and therapeutic areas, and supporting prevention solutions in partnership with the local government and private healthcare institutions. This has included partnerships with government bodies and NGOs to implement smoking cessation programs and to address early stages of heart disease, as well as the establishment of programs to offer healthcare providers ongoing medical education.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pfizer has complemented its work in the Kingdom with a number of research projects designed to better understand the prevalence and impact of diseases in the country and potential innovative treatment options. The company had several clinical trials ongoing in Saudi Arabia, involving more than 700 patients. The research is focused on eight clinical areas: cardiovascular disease, infectious disease, inflammation, oncology, ophthalmology, respiratory disease, transplantation, and vaccination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Current investment and localization</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As this suggests, Pfizer has become an integral part of the Saudi healthcare sector over the last five decades. The company currently has more than 400 employees in Saudi Arabia. While its presence has long been successful and notable, Pfizer took its relationship with the country to a new level in 2017. In January of that year, the company formally opened its first manufacturing facility in the Kingdom. This localization effort was the fruit of productive discussions held with the government and SAGIA since 2011.&nbsp; Pfizer is recognized by the government as a committed partner. In June 2016 SAGIA issued a trading license to allow Pfizer to obtain full ownership of its legal entity in the kingdom.&nbsp; As a result, the pharmaceutical company is now able to, among other things, import, export and trade in through Pfizer Saudi Limited, thus ensuring an uninterrupted supply of its innovative and essential medicines into Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The initial investment in the new Pfizer manufacturing facility reached approximately $70m. Pfizer made the decision to focus initially on its main product lines with a view to the long-term sustainability of these products in the market. The uniqueness of these products and their important therapeutic capabilities were key concerns. The manufacturing facility covers seven clinical areas, including cardiovascular disease, antibiotics, antidepressants, non-steroidal painkillers, and neurological products. More than 60% of the volume of medicines that the company supplies are fully manufactured in Saudi Arabia. The medicines that the company produces in these key areas have stable demand and thus offer predictable business volume. Furthermore, the company believes that demand for these important treatments will be sufficient from a scale perspective.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Local impact</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>The new facility will undoubtedly help Pfizer in terms of managing its supply chain and delivery capabilities in one of its most important Middle Eastern markets. The investment will also have significant benefits for the Kingdom as well. When Pfizer launched its manufacturing facility, it had about 120 employees working there, of whom more than 50% are Saudi. As such, the company is committed to cultivating and employing local talent. This is achieved through a combination of recourse to the labor market and in-house training and internship programs that develop local talent..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pfizer has hired Saudis for many of its main and lead jobs, including the technical head of the new manufacturing facility. In each and every department, the company has employed a Saudi head or senior manager. Pfizer&rsquo;s training program is also expanding. For example, the number of summer trainees trebled in the last year. Under this program, pharmacy students are given the requisite training so that they will have the capability to join Pfizer when they finish their studies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pfizer&rsquo;s investment in both local manufacturing and human resources illustrates the importance the company places in aligning itself with the government&rsquo;s ambition for the sector under its Vision 2030 development strategy. By 2020, the government has set a target for local pharmaceuticals manufacturing to account for 40% of the total market value, starting from a base of around 20% in 2016. At the same time, the government hopes to push the pharmaceutical industry&rsquo;s contribution to non-oil GDP from 0.98% in 2016 to 1.97%. These goals should boost local value in terms of employment and the local supply chain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Distribution hub potential</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pfizer has made new investments and expanded in the market in no small part because its goals align with those of the government as outlined in Vision 2030 and because the government has placed a renewed emphasis on supporting the development of the local pharmaceutical industry.</p>
<p>Currently, the company is focusing exclusively on manufacturing for the local market. However, in the medium to long term, it envisages a situation in which Saudi Arabia could serve as a hub for distribution throughout the region. Pfizer is keenly aware that it needs to keep pushing forward, aligning its work with SAGIA to maintain its prominent position in the local market.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having acquired an industrial land area more than double the size of the current manufacturing space the company already has ample potential to expand. Its initial experience provides evidence of the speed of progress &ndash; though the company had planned to build capacity steadily through secondary and primary manufacturing, it has jumped straight to full manufacturing in a short time. This serves as a useful illustration of Pfizer&rsquo;s potential for growth and expansion. While the company has a long and distinguished history in the market, it continues to look to the future.</p>

<h4>CEO Interview</h4>
<p><em>Dr&nbsp;Alaa Abd El Ghany Gamal, Country Manager, Pfizer Essential Health Saudi Arabia Lead</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How has Pfizer&rsquo;s relationship with the Saudi market changed in recent years?</p>
<p>Pfizer has a diverse portfolio and is one of the premier biopharmaceutical companies globally and in Saudi Arabia. To do this, we work closely with the government and strive to ensure that we have the best service in place. Our relationship with the country has been evolving over time as we have increased the size of our business and service in the Kingdom. The scaling up of the scope of our local operations was initiated in 2011, when discussions with the government and SAGIA started to focus on expanding our presence and adding manufacturing facilities in the country. Localization was initiated in 2013 and we opened the facility formally in January 2017.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is part of Pfizer&rsquo;s long-term vision to stay in the market and expand in the market. For some time now, Saudi Arabia is one of the few countries in which we decided to launch a new manufacturing facility. This reflects the extent to which Pfizer is interested in and cares about the country, but is also a testament to how competitive Saudi Arabia is becoming regionally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We were awarded a trading license from SAGIA in 2016. We were one of only three companies to get a license at the time and the first pharmaceutical company. This is very encouraging and motivating for us. The manufacturing facility and the trading license highlight the government&rsquo;s efforts in attracting leading healthcare companies like Pfizer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why did Pfizer decide to open a manufacturing facility in Saudi Arabia?</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, this is part of our commitment to the country and to patients in the Kingdom. Added to that, the Saudi government offered an attractive proposition by providing the right supporting infrastructure for our manufacturing facility. The encouragement that we have received from SAGIA and the government has facilitated our decision to be here. We also see this as a long-term investment. Although there are some ups and downs, Saudi Arabia is our anchor in the Africa and Middle East region. We needed to complement our existence here with a manufacturing facility, and Vision 2030 helped a lot in this respect. The alignment of Pfizer&rsquo;s goals with the country&rsquo;s objectives, combined with the impetus of Vision 2030, represents a perfect match and is among the main factors that will drive us and other companies to invest more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are the conditions that make the local healthcare and pharmaceutical market attractive for investors?</p>
<p>The size of the therapeutic area and the size of the market are critical. You need to have scale to run a pharmaceutical manufacturing plant sustainably in any market &ndash; and Saudi Arabia has that. In addition, you need stability. In this respect, Saudi Arabia is not a market that is changing every year. The Kingdom has stable market dynamics, which are very important in order to make a big investment like the one we made in our local facility. Stability also involves pricing and transparency of tendering and investment laws. These are things we are expecting and these are things we are seeing from the government. The clarity on governance was really important for us and has encouraged us to take the investment decision.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What specific steps has the government taken in recent years to increase stability and predictability?</p>
<p>Many aspects of the government&rsquo;s working practices are encouraging. We have seen a true partnership mindset with SAGIA. This is critical. Then, on the regulatory side, the Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA) has greatly improved clarity for market participants. It has accelerated the registration process, which allows products to get to market faster. The SFDA has also expedited the bridging process for products with prior FDA approval in the US or European Union to 60 working days or 30 working days. This is amazing both for Saudi Arabia and the region. When you change policies in Saudi Arabia, it affects the whole region, as other countries will follow this process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How challenging was the process of getting a SAGIA trading license?</p>
<p>To have a local entity, we had to work both internally and with the government. When we went to the government to make the case for having a trading license, we had already developed the rationale internally. It is about building trust and a partnership mindset. To be the first pharmaceutical company to get such a license was the result of all parties having the right mindset: the government, SAGIA, and Pfizer itself. We worked together with full transparency and clarity. We have set a precedent that will make the process easier for other international companies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Pfizer, the objective was to have a sustainable model for the Saudi market by ensuring a consistent supply of our medication, something we could not necessarily ensure under the old model. The license allows us to have control over our own supply chain. There is, as always, a reputational risk and we wanted to ensure that we have the right tools in place. We feel satisfied that we do.</p> "

<p>Saudi Arabia today boasts one the largest pharmaceutical markets in the GCC region, and one that has experienced exponential growth over the past century. Several factors have contributed to the expansion of the Saudi pharmaceutical market, including a growing population and rising GDP per capita, as well as an increasing incidence of non-communicable diseases, which typically require long-term treatment and management.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2016, Saudi Arabia launched its Vision 2030 strategy, which identifies the local pharmaceutical industry as key to the growth of the Kingdom&rsquo;s non-oil industrial base. To this end, the government is establishing an ecosystem that encourages domestic and international pharmaceutical players to invest in expanding the sector&rsquo;s local capabilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this context, the British healthcare company which has a strong focus and leading position in Respiratory, HIV, Vaccines as well as many famous consumer brands, GSK, whom has been selling products in Saudi Arabia for 60 years, has been expanding its operations of late.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>GSK ascendant</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Indeed, the company&rsquo;s history in the Kingdom has largely been told over the last quarter-century. In 1992, GSK partnered with the local Banaja Holding Company Limited and began operating within Saudi Arabia. The plant built by the partners was the first multinational pharmaceutical plant established in Saudi Arabia and a real statement of intent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The move, which was pioneering at a time when the Kingdom&rsquo;s pharmaceutical industry was in its infancy, gave GSK a strong position in the market. While the company has faced a number of challenges in the local market in the intervening years, it has retained its preeminent place in Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s pharmaceutical industry. Its manufacturing facilities have been repeatedly upgraded and modernized over the last 25 years. Today, 80% of its product portfolio is locally manufactured in Jeddah.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Moreover, the local footprint has expanded substantially in the last decade. In 2012, GSK took the decision to localize the manufacture of between 40 and 50 products all at once. Then, in 2013, the company began packaging vaccines locally. It was the first manufacturing of any kind of vaccine product in Saudi Arabia. On the back of these decisions the business grew rapidly, so that by 2014 GSK was the number-one pharmaceutical company in the market. With the wind at its back, the British firm signed a deal with its local partner, Banaja Holding Company Limited, to look at further localization of vaccines. Following a change in the foreign ownership laws in the Kingdom in 2017, the GSK acquired an extra 26% share in the local company and now has an ownership stake of 75% in GSK Saudi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>A promising local landscape</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These moves come at a time when the Saudi Arabian pharmaceutical market is taking off. A combination of government support, the drive for diversification and a rapidly expanding consumer market is feeding the local industry. The Kingdom already accounts for 59.4% of all pharmaceutical product purchases in the GCC. This is unlikely to change anytime soon, with the market growing at an average of approximately 10% each year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, under the National Transformation Program (NTP) and Vision 2030, the government has set ambitious targets for the sector, including increasing its share in non-oil GDP from a baseline figure of 0.98% to 1.97% by 2020. Similarly, the government envisages the share of local manufacturing to the total pharmaceutical market value rising from 20% to 40% over the same time period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Investing with a long-term view</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>As such, while GSK has certain advantages as an early entrant to the market, it cannot afford to rest on its laurels. The company plans to maintain its preeminent position in the market and has committed to explore all opportunities to invest more over the next three years. This includes plans to expand its production operations in Jeddah by 30% in that period, as well as other investments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company calls this a &ldquo;new phase&rdquo; and has already begun talks with SAGIA and the government about what else it plans to do in the local market. GSK opened a Technical Scientific Services Office and is now looking at launching a trade entity. The company envisages that such moves and the current investment drive will serve it for the next 10 to 20 years, just as the establishment of a manufacturing facility in the early 1990s laid the platform for its success over the last two decades.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company takes a long-term view, which is a reflection of its belief in the country. GSK is currently studying the prospect of using Saudi Arabia as an export hub for the entire GCC. These, however, are likely to be medium- to long-term goals. Saudi production currently only supplies the domestic market, while the GCC continues to be served by the company&rsquo;s global plants in Europe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other longer-term ambitions include the possibility of research and development operations within the Kingdom, although this will be dependent on strengthening of the regulatory and technical capacity of local regulatory institutions. On the whole, however, nothing is off the table. The scope of operations in the Kingdom is only likely to be limited by questions of scale and market size. As such, a number of new products, including a range of vaccines and biotech products, could feasibly be added to the company&rsquo;s roster in the coming decades.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the shorter term, the company is focused on meeting its localization commitments, not only in terms of content and production, but also in terms of human resources. This includes plans to improve retention rates for Saudi employees and a revitalization of the hiring and training process for local staff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This willingness to nurture local talent, deploy capital in the Saudi market, and develop a long-term strategy for growth illustrates the success of the localization of pharmaceutical operations in the Kingdom. Indeed, the story of GSK in Saudi Arabia is confirmation of the viability of the government&rsquo;s plans for the wider industry under the Vision 2030.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h3><strong>CEO Interview</strong></h3>
<p><em>Luciano Andrade, Country Manager of GSK Saudi Arabia</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What are the current conditions for investment in Saudi Arabia?</strong></p>
<p>When we look at the size of the population, the strategic position of the country geographically speaking, the importance this country has in a political and economic sense for the GCC and the wider Middle East, and the activity being done with the Vision 2030, all these things are unique conditions that make us think differently about the market. And we as GSK &ndash; because of our 65 years here and because of our manufacturing facility being located here in Saudi Arabia, with 80% of our products already localized in a certain way &ndash; we consider ourselves in a very strategic position to be part of the growth that the Kingdom expects from the private sector and the local pharmaceutical industry in the coming years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The choices that we make now and the capacity to partner with the government on Vision 2030 will determine whether or not we succeed with our investment. But the conditions are there for it. Saudi Arabia is a country that looks for good healthcare access for the population. That&rsquo;s critical for us. We are also supporting and aligning with a country that believes in innovation and protects innovation. There needs to continue to be sustainable pricing conditions compared to other emerging markets. This will be one of the determining factors to define our next move &ndash; the willingness of the government to make the environment more predictable. There needs to be the right purchasing policy that will incentivize the kind of investment that brings new technology and innovation into the country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What can feasibly be localized in Saudi Arabia?</strong></p>
<p>I think there are some products and technologies that you can localize, especially tablets. The main condition sometimes is scale. If you go too niche in terms of disease, the localization might not make sense from a scale perspective. One global plant might make the scale more realistic. With a population of over 30m, the scale of the Saudi market is fine for some disease treatments. Having said that, what we need is predictable purchase terms and capacity to export, as well as the technical and regulatory capacity to absorb new production. To bring new vaccines here will trigger new challenges for the regulator, the Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA), in terms of how it sets the right parameters and analysis. It will require adjustments, but I believe we can bring even biotech products to Saudi Arabia. Localization of production is a matter of scale, predictability, price and the patience to develop technical capabilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is an appetite for research and development (R&amp;D) locally. The view is right. The pharmaceutical industry is investing much more in R&amp;D than production. But it is important to keep in mind that R&amp;D is a complex situation from the perspective of local knowledge, compliance and IP protection. At present, it is predominantly located in the US and Europe because of these established ecosystems. We can develop it in Saudi Arabia, but we need to keep in mind that we will be competing with other developed pharmaceutical markets in terms of its capabilities and regulation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Have there been improvements in regulation and the registration of new products for the domestic market?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, definitely. The SFDA is making a massive effort to speed up innovation, which is a really positive improvement. The country as a whole is showing impressive efforts to make business easier. There are several reasons why we believe that Saudi Arabia will continue to support and create conditions for innovation. One of these conditions is a relatively fast and very reliable regulatory process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What were the challenges in establishing local operations and how did you overcome them?</strong></p>
<p>In the last year, there have been a lot of changes. I think there is an adaptation that needs to happen with the Saudi population and the way private multinational companies operate. There is an important cultural adjustment taking place in terms of processes and the adoption of global best practices. We welcome the push for Saudization, which we believe is the right direction for the local economy to follow in the long term. We can argue about the speed of the adjustment, but we fully understand where the country is heading. Having said that, we are dealing with a much higher level of turnover than we experience in other markets around the globe, and this requires the adoption of innovative hiring strategies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have many good examples of Saudi staff that grew and developed within our local facilities and are contributing to the growth of the industry. We have established a future leader program. We are hiring Saudi graduates each year and rotating them through different positions as well as different global GSK locations. We offer them long-term plan to develop their capabilities, and then count on them to lead the business in Saudi Arabia in the future.

<p><strong>How would you assess the infrastructure and logistics environment in Saudi Arabia? What are the competitive advantages?</strong></p>
<p>As an established company, we are still facing some issues on the Customs side, as well as on ports and visas procedures. In particular, the latter is critical, because if we want to expand our business and bring in new technology, we need to bring in technicians that come from all over the world. We do, however, see some improvements in this respect.</p>

<p>If you look from the perspective of a new company entering the market, the Kingdom&rsquo;s main competitive advantages are the investment effort brought about by SAGIA and the new economic cities.

This was to help KKESH train a new generation of leaders in ophthalmology to treat the people of Saudi Arabia and neighboring Gulf countries. The second collaboration was when Johns Hopkins Medicine (JHM) signed a health care joint venture with Saudi Aramco, in 2014. The resulting independent company, Johns Hopkins Aramco Healthcare (JHAH), is truly unique in terms of its scope and impact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of the Joint Venture, Johns Hopkins Medicine and Saudi Aramco both have an indirect ownership interest in the Saudi-registered company JHAH. The purpose of the agreement is to provide medical services to Saudi Aramco&rsquo;s approximately 360,000 employees and dependents, education for its clinicians and other health care professionals and opportunities for research collaborations.</p>
<p>The main JHAH hospital, located in Dhahran, is a state-of-the-art, 330-bed referral institution that has five intensive care units (cardiac, medical, surgical, pediatric and neonatal) in addition to numerous step-down units. JHAH also operates health centers in Abqaiq, al Hasa, Ras Tanura and &lsquo;Udhailiyah. JHAH works with a network of more than 80 medical providers contracting with primary, secondary and tertiary facilities Kingdom-wide. Additionally, JHAH operates remote area clinics, providing around-the-clock emergency medical support to Saudi Aramco operations. JHAH employs 5,200 people - 3,000 Saudi Aramco employees seconded to JHAH, 600 JHAH direct hires and 1,600 contracted employees.</p>
<p>The affiliation with KKESH&nbsp; brought together two institutions that are both world leaders in treating and curing eye disease. The Wilmer Eye Institute at Johns Hopkins is an internationally renowned eye institution that diagnoses and manages complex medical and surgical eye disease and serves as a preeminent eye care provider. With 250 beds, KKESH is the largest ophthalmic tertiary referral center in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.&nbsp; The goal of the affiliation is to combine Johns Hopkins&rsquo; medical expertise and KKESH&rsquo;s huge volume of eye patients to develop treatments for eye diseases that afflict patients living in both countries and around the world.</p> "

                          ; dhl-success-story  ;                ; "<p><strong>A world-class logistics hub</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Express service built over time</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When DHL first entered the Saudi market bringing goods into the Kingdom was a laborious process. For many years, it did not get any easier. Imports were flown to Bahrain and then trucked across the King Fahd Causeway after it opened in 1986.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, things have changed dramatically. Approximately, 75% of the company&rsquo;s shipments are cleared by Customs in the air before they even land on Saudi soil. The causeway, once the lifeblood of the Kingdom&rsquo;s trade, now represents less than 10% of DHL&rsquo;s Saudi volumes. As such, the company has prospered in the country by recognizing that the express part of the logistics industry is just as advanced in Saudi Arabia as that in America, or Asia, or Europe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The story of DHL in Saudi Arabia is the story of the company and the country as a whole. DHL has been present in the Kingdom for over 40 years. It began operations just seven years after the parent company was established in the US in 1969. DHL&rsquo;s arrival in Saudi Arabia came at a time when the economy was taking off and the government&rsquo;s new strategy of five-year economic plans was spurring development across the country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is perhaps unsurprising, therefore, that Saudi Arabia is an important market for DHL. The company has expanded to become the largest express integrator in the Kingdom, with in excess of 52% market share in revenue and 47% in volumes. It has approximately 22 aircraft rotations into the Kingdom each week. It is flying Boeing 757s on a daily basis to the two main gateways, with plans to expand further into Dammam and has a fleet of over 500 vehicles in the Kingdom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Investing in logistics gateways</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2016, Saudi Arabia launched its Vision 2030 plan to grow and diversify the economy building on some key strategic pillars. Among these, Vision 2030 aims to leverage the Kingdom&rsquo;s unique geographical location at the crossroads of international trade routes across Asia, Africa and Europe to strengthen its role a regional logistical hub.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this scenario, DHL is not resting on its laurels as it continues to invest in its people, its infrastructure, and its technology. The company&rsquo;s vehicle fleet has been growing constantly and it continues to introduce its latest global technology to the Saudi market. In 2017, for example, the company launched a service that allows a customer to choose a change of address during the transit of shipments. The customer can also now dictate delivery time and not just the day. It is also working towards the rollout of an online shopping platform where customers can buy goods online through a dedicated DHL platform that offers secure shipping.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, in the last three years, DHL has invested approximately $60m in a number of projects, primarily enhancing its Customs clearance facilities with dedicated gateways at each of the major international airports, starting at Dammam, followed by Riyadh, and most recently Jeddah opened in September 2017. These latter two facilities have dedicated aircraft serving them twice a day, while all facilities have in-house Customs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The in-house Customs facilities are a good example of the benefits of developing a strong and deep relationship with the Kingdom. DHL has had a relationship with Saudi Customs for 40 years and has managed to improve its market position by gaining clearance to establish its in-house Customs service. However, this is not just to the advantage of DHL. The move also pushes forward the logistics environment in the country as a whole.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Logistics companies and investors can in this respect play an enabling role for the country. DHL not only helps drive Customs practices, but also plays a role in supporting knowledge and technology transfer for the local logistics industry. The company has had a number of discussions and conversations with government bodies and had the opportunity to showcase its facilities. DHL sees itself as the first contact point with authorities when it comes to logistics and just-in-time deliveries or express platforms. At the same time, the government sees the company&rsquo;s facilities in Riyadh and Jeddah as leading international-standard facilities and encourages new investors to visit the company&rsquo;s facilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Overcoming challenges</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>DHL&rsquo;s local success has not come without challenges. Indeed, its ability to prosper is, in large part, attributable to its flexibility and adaptability. This has been evident in the last year with a significant increase in the price of fuel. In January 2018, the government raised the price of domestic gasoline and jet fuel by 80%. Given DHL&rsquo;s extensive fleet of aircraft and road vehicles, the move has had a substantial impact on the company&rsquo;s cost model. Some of this burden has been passed on to the customer, while the company has absorbed the rest. Nevertheless, Saudi Arabia still remains one of the cheapest markets globally in terms of the cost of fuel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Kingdom still has a competitive advantage in fuel feedstock, and the increase was small in the grand scheme of things, according to DHL. Indeed, fuel is still a fairly small percentage of the company&rsquo;s operating cost regardless of the recent increase. DHL is sanguine about the move. The company has been in Saudi Arabia for 40 years and has had to be very flexible and adapt quickly to changes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Future market growth</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>As Saudi Arabia looks to fulfill its development agenda under the Vision 2030, the opportunities for the logistics industry and express carriers are only likely to grow. Today, as much as 80% of DHL&rsquo;s Saudi revenue is supported by inbound products. However, as the economy diversifies and industrialization intensifies, exports should grow, bringing new and expanding revenue streams to logistics companies like DHL. Vision 2030 aims to raise the share of non-oil exports from 16% to 50% of non-oil GDP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, with Amazon in talks with the government about entering the market, the local sector is positioning itself to take advantage of any growth opportunities. Amazon is already a DHL customer globally and takes advantage of the firm to bring shipments into the Kingdom. Having the global giant as a legal entity in the Kingdom, however, would likely be a game changer for DHL and other express carriers. It would probably help the company facilitate its requirements much easier and faster. The market would not only grow, but also add value to the end customer because products would become cheaper.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Such moves illustrate the growing importance of the Saudi market and its ability to meet international logistics standards. The country has come a long way since the days when trade was at the end of a causeway. As the country looks to transition into the age of digitization and automation, traditional investors such as DHL and prospective logistics players all have a major role to play.</p>

<h3><strong>CEO Interview</strong></h3>
<p><em>Faysal El Hajjami, Vice-President and Country General Manager, DHL Saudi Arabia</em></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How has your experience as an investor evolved in recent years?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have witnessed DHL in the Saudi market evolve. I don&rsquo;t think DHL would have invested in Saudi Arabia if we were not strongly committed to the Kingdom&rsquo;s growth. The Saudi market is one of the large markets in our network. It is a market that is good to do business in for a number of reasons. We have a young and growing population, and we have great support from the government authorities. It is a market that has welcomed our technology and know-how, and it&rsquo;s a profitable market and we&rsquo;re proud to say so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think it is important for any investor to feel safe in a market, to feel encouraged by the government, and to feel that they can repatriate their profits. Saudi Arabia is just that. It has its challenges like any other market, but overall, if you work hard to promote your technology and services, you will succeed. It is primarily an in-bound market, but we are now working closely with the government and some of our customers to develop export products. It has been, generally speaking, an extremely stable market for us. You have a younger generation that is tech savvy and keen on international products. Just as importantly, it is also a market that has fairly high levels of disposable income.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Where do you see the potential for export opportunities?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a number of young entrepreneurs that are developing products and services. I have seen the opportunities these products and services create in other markets, so I believe there will be a lot of know-how and tech services that are going to be exported. Additionally, there is the medical sector. There are a number of products being produced here that will be ready for export, including pharmaceuticals. Then of course, there are the subsectors of oil and gas, whether it is plastic resins or other products. The automotive industry could be developed here and available for export, as well as the avionics sector, which the government is keen to bring to this part of the world. We are optimistic and very close to what is happening. There is much potential.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How have Saudi trade relations changed?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There has been a shift in the last decade. There has historically been a heavy reliance on the US trade lane in particular. This was our biggest trade lane. Today, there is a major shift towards Asia, including Hong Kong, China, and India. Europe is also important. Germany, in particular, is a large exporter to the Saudi market. I think there is a balanced and diversified trade environment. The US, Asia, and Europe are now all big exporters and players in Saudi Arabia. This shows on our trade lanes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The government is seeking to make Saudi Arabia a trans-shipment and logistics hub. Is this realistic and what could the government do to attract more trans-shipment business to Saudi Arabia?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Intra-regionally, the UAE remains the biggest trade link. The UAE has managed to position itself as an entry point for cargo business. It takes bulk cargo and redistributes to the rest of the region. I think Saudi Arabia has the potential to create a similar set up in the Kingdom. For that to happen, a number of government bodies need to come together to set up the enabling environment. This would involve flexibility on visas, cohesive and aligned customs systems and processes, and many other factors. The legislative side needs to be addressed. The investor or the exporter needs to feel that the goods will enter the Kingdom on time and will reach their end user without jeopardizing the integrity of the goods. Then of course, in terms of infrastructure there should be dedicated bonded areas for air, road, sea, and potentially rail. There is also a huge demand for cool chain logistics, so there is need for refrigeration in both bonded and non-bonded areas. The infrastructure side is perhaps easier to achieve then the latter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But is the potential there? Absolutely. Could that shorten the supply chain? Absolutely. Could that add value to the customer? It would certainly reduce the landing cost to the customer. There is a fantastic business case for this. It does not surprise me that the government is looking at it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>To what extent have Customs procedures improved in the last few years?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without a shadow of a doubt we would not have been able to grow our volumes into the Kingdom by double digits over the last three years had we not seen flexibility of operations with the Customs authorities. Today, approximately 75% of our shipments are cleared in the air. However, there is a lot of work that our team needs to do in advance. This is why we pride ourselves on our transit time. In 2017, we achieved a record whereby 96.3% of all our shipments were received on time by the customer. We moved from 93% to 96.3%. This had never happened in Saudi Arabia. I think this model can be applied to sea freight, road freight and any other logistics platforms the Kingdom is looking to develop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How has the growth of e-commerce and online trading in Saudi Arabia compared to other markets?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think MENA has been recognized as the region with the highest online business growth. It will have the most growth in 2019 out of all regions. While the online segment has matured in some markets, I don&rsquo;t think it has reached maturity in this market yet. We have seen in excess of 30% growth, but I don&rsquo;t think we have reached the peak yet. We can comfortably say that 35% of all our business coming into the Kingdom is driven by online purchases. And it is growing by double digits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What can you say about the potential localization of technology in Saudi Arabia?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a global logistics network we are very systemized; we are not a standalone company. DHL Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s technology is just as good as DHL US&rsquo;s technology or DHL China&rsquo;s technology. Saudi Arabia is a tier-one market, one of the top countries in the world. This is where technology is rolled out first. So DHL Saudi Arabia possesses the latest technology in our network. That is an advantage for our local company and the customer. We are recognizing the changes that digitization is creating and also the demands of the younger generation, especially in such a dynamic market like Saudi Arabia. We are trying to deploy locally as much as we can and as fast as we can for the Kingdom to stay ahead of the game.</p> "

The 25-year build-transfer-operate (BTO) contract was the first of its kind in Saudi Arabia and the airport has witnessed a 70% rise in passenger traffic since the project&rsquo;s launch in 2012, with an award-winning new passenger terminal inaugurated in July 2015.</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>A landmark in Saudi privatization initiatives</em></p>
<p>Established in 1997, TAV Airports is the largest airport operator in Turkey, with five airports in Turkey and a further 12 airports abroad under its operation. Through its various subsidiaries, TAV Airports offers airside and landside operation services, including security, ground handling, IT solutions and retail, while its sister company, TAV Construction, provides airport engineering services. France-based operator Groupe ADP has bought into TAV&rsquo;s capital in 2012 and further strengthened its presence in 2017, creating a significant global network that handles over 250m passengers a year.</p>
<p>The Medina Airport contract marked TAV Airport&rsquo;s entry into the Saudi market. Since achieving international status in 2007, the airport had witnessed a significant increase in traffic that threatened to exceed its capacity of 5m passengers per year. This prompted the Saudi General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA), in consultation with the World Bank&rsquo;s International Finance Corporation, to announce a 25-year BTO tender for the expansion and operation of the airport in 2011. In partnership with the Saudi firms Al Rajhi Holding Group and Saudi Oger, TAV Airports submitted a bid for the contract and was announced as the winner in August 2011.</p>
<p>To execute the contract, TAV Airports and its two Saudi partners jointly established the special-purpose vehicle TIBAH Airports Development Company, which inked the Medina Airport contract with GACA on October 29, 2011. Under the terms of the agreement, TAV Airports would take over operation of the airport for a 25-year period, during which TAV Construction &ndash; in partnership with Al Arrab Contracting Company (ACC) &ndash; would also develop a new passenger terminal and carry out various runway improvements. For its part, GACA would retain its position as regulator, operate air traffic control and receive a share of the airport&rsquo;s revenue. After signing the agreement, TAV Airports declared its pride at being involved in such a prestigious project and expressed its enthusiasm about the prospect of developing pilgrimage links between Medina Airport and its airports in Turkey, such as Istanbul Ataturk Airport.</p>
<p>The agreement constituted a landmark moment in Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s recent efforts to increase private sector participation in the economy. It represented the first full public private partnership (PPP) in the Kingdom, with GACA retaining ownership of the airport while benefitting from TIBAH&rsquo;s investment and TAV Airport&rsquo;s operational expertise. Additionally, it was the first time in Saudi aviation history that a private company assumed management of an airport&rsquo;s operations. Finally, TIBAH and its lenders &ndash; National Commercial Bank, Arab National Bank, and Saudi British Bank &ndash; reached an innovative $1.2bn financing agreement that was sensitive to the need for state ownership of a strategic asset such as an airport, while remaining faithful to sharia principles. In recognition of this, both the 2012 PFI Awards hosted by Thomson Reuters and the 2013 Euromoney Islamic Finance Awards handed prizes to the financing agreements&rsquo; organizers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Award-winning results</em></p>
<p>TAV Construction and ACC broke ground on the new passenger terminal in the first half of 2012 and TAV Airports and Al Rajhi Group took over operation of the airport in June the same year. The consortium completed the first phase of work, which increased the airport&rsquo;s annual capacity to 8m passengers, ahead of schedule in February 2015. Successful test flights took place in April that year, with Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud&nbsp;officially inaugurating the new Medina Airport on July 2, 2015. The new 150,000-metre Islamic-inspired passenger terminal has a designated Hajj Terminal area, as well as six external pavilions nearby, to accommodate the increased passenger traffic during the Hajj pilgrimage period.</p>
<p>In terms of meeting GACA&rsquo;s primary aims for the project, namely modernizing Medina Airport and expanding its capacity, the project has been a resounding success; the airport welcomed over 7.8m passengers in 2017 compared with 4.6m in 2012, when redevelopment began. This physical growth has also been reflected in growing revenues, which reached SR879m ($234m) in 2017, up from SR732m ($195m) in 2016 and SR565m ($151m) in 2015.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since its inauguration, the airport has won a host of global and regional awards in recognition of its design and operation. These include, among others, the World&rsquo;s Best Airport Project at the 2015 Global Construction Summit in New York and GCC Airport Project of the Year award at the 2016 MEED Quality Awards for projects. It has also won plaudits for its commitment to the environment and was the first construction project in the MENA region to receive a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED Gold) from the US Green Building Council.</p>
<p>Additionally, TIBAH has demonstrated a strong commitment to the Kingdom&rsquo;s Saudiization program, investing in local talent by bringing in experts from across its global network to conduct extensive training exercises. Over the last three years, Saudi nationals have comprised on average 60% of TIBAH&rsquo;s near 600-strong workforce.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>An expanding footprint in Saudi Arabia</em></p>
<p>With the first phase of the Medina Airport project complete, TAV Airports and Al Rajhi Group are now in the planning stage for the next phase of work, under which the airport&rsquo;s capacity will increase to around 15m passengers annually. If a third provisional phase included in the agreement with TIBAH is implemented, Medina Airport could become the port of arrival for almost 30m travelers a year.</p>
<p>In a partial testament to the success of the Medina Airport project, GACA named TAV Airports and Al Rajhi Holding Group as the winners of two 30-year BTO agreements tendered in early 2017 for the expansion of Yanbu Airport, Hail Airport and Qassim Airport. The contracts will see the joint annual capacity of Yanbu, Hail and Qassim airports increased from 4.7m to 11.5m passengers per year, with a total investment of $400m USD. Shortly after winning the new airport BTO agreements, TAV Airports and Al Rajhi Holding Group also announced the joint buy-out of Saudi Oger&rsquo;s stake in TIBAH, taking their respective shares in the Medina Airport project to 50% - a deal which is yet to be closed. In 2018, TAV Airports and Al Rajhi Group established PAN Airports. PAN Airports is the first private airport operation company in the region and it will serve as an umbrella holding company, covering all activities of the JV, including TİBAH. PAN Airports is expected to seek airport investment opportunities in the region.</p>
<p>Similarly, TAV Airports&rsquo; sister company, TAV Construction, has won build contracts for a new terminal at Riyadh Airport and for hangars at Jeddah Airport, again in partnership with ACC.</p>
<p>These contracts are at the forefront of a national drive to develop aviation facilities through private partnerships. The private sector is expected to play a major role in achieving Vision 2030&rsquo;s aim to strengthen Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s position as a regional transport hub. With this goal in mind, the government created the Saudi Civil Aviation Holding Company in 2017 as a separate entity from the regulator GACA. The company is 100% owned by the Public Investment Fund, the Kingdom&rsquo;s sovereign wealth fund, and is in the process of corporatizing each airport as a preliminary stage for privatization or PPP agreements.</p>
<p>In this context, TAV Airports and other prospective investors will be presented with an increasing number of opportunities to participate in the transport sector and support the achievement of the Kingdom&rsquo;s development goals.</p>

<h3><strong>CEO Interview</strong></h3>
<p><em>Mustafa Sani Şener, President and CEO, TAV Airports Holding</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>How would you describe TAV&rsquo;s overall experience as a foreign investor in Saudi Arabia?</strong></p>
<p>The build-transfer-operate (BTO) contract for the development of Prince Mohammad Bin Abdulaziz International Airport (Medina Airport) was TAV&rsquo;s first investment in Saudi Arabia. As the first full public private partnership (PPP) project here, it&rsquo;s a historically significant project in the Kingdom, both in the aviation industry and more generally. To date it has been a productive and fruitful investment. We feel proud to have been trusted with the important task of serving the pilgrims and visitors to The Holy Prophet&rsquo;s city and we are delighted to have received a number of honors, awards and distinctions that acknowledge our commitment to, and strategic direction of, this prestigious project. For example, Medina Airport was awarded the 2017 ACI Airport Service Quality Award, which is based on passenger surveys, for Best Airport in Middle East in the category of airports serving 5m-15m passengers per year.</p>
<p>We are continuously investing and innovating to offer the best travel experience to our passengers and to improve the quality of services provided at Medina Airport. Today, we are in a very good position in Saudi Arabia and the future looks promising, with several exciting new developments coming through in the last year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How has the coordination been with government bodies and with your local partners?</strong></p>
<p>From the outset, TIBAH Airports Development Company has coordinated closely with the Saudi General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA), while also having regular contact with the Emirate of Medina Province, SAGIA, the Ministry of Transport, the Ministry of Hajj and Umrah, the Immigration Department, relevant Customs authorities, and other government agencies, local bodies and airline operators. We have found all of these bodies to be highly cooperative and committed to our partnership.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TAV has an extensive track record managing different airports around the world and so we were already familiar with the logistical challenges that coordinating with multiple government bodies can present, particularly in this instance considering that the Medina Airport project is the country&rsquo;s first airport privatization. Our local partner Al Rajhi Holding Group has played a vital role in helping to overcome some of the difficulties associated with this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What sets Saudi Arabia apart from regional peers in terms of its attractiveness to foreign investors?</strong></p>
<p>Some of the pull factors that set Saudi Arabia apart from other countries in the region include its dynamic and promising aviation sector, its strategic geographic position, its young and educated population, and the significant potential for growth in the religious tourism sector. Likewise, the Kingdom&rsquo;s ambitious Vision 2030 plan is a clear demonstration of the government&rsquo;s intent to encourage private investment and promote tourism, multi-dimensional privatization initiatives, and radical market liberalization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>To what extent do you expect the privatization of the Kingdom&rsquo;s airports to change the landscape of tourism, transport and logistics?</strong></p>
<p>I anticipate the privatization of the Kingdom&rsquo;s airports to have a significant impact on local economies, particularly in the tourism, transport, and logistics sectors. In practical terms, the privatization of airports will finance massive airport expansions, thereby generating direct jobs. Above and beyond this, however, the consequent increase in international commerce and tourism can provide additional indirect employment opportunities. In sum, I see the privatization of airports as engendering potentially significant boosts to local economies and, by extension, the national economy.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>How would you rate the Saudi talent you are able to hire in the Kingdom, and what strategy has TAV adopted to address hiring and training?</strong></p>
<p>During the initial phase of our project, we conducted research and analysis of the Saudi labor market to inform our recruitment and training strategy. As such, when we started hiring local talent we already had a comprehensive plan in place to train up our Saudi employees to the point where they were qualified to operate a world-class airport. We brought in experts from our other operations in Turkey, Georgia, Macedonia, and Tunisia, among others, to pass on their knowledge of best practice in their respective fields, and we coordinated with international training institutes to deliver globally recognized training where relevant. I should add that we also received support from Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s Human Resources Development Fund to offer on-the-job-training for our local employees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From a strategic point of view, we view our Saudi talent as a long-term investment. If we invest in Saudiization now, we will get our return in the future. Accordingly, our human resources (HR) team plays a significant role in the development of talent and localization of jobs. We provide our employees with job security and opportunities for personal development, while our HR team has developed sets of key performance indicators for each position and provides guidance so motivated individuals can advance within TIBAH. We also fully support Vision 2030&rsquo;s commitment to increasing employment rates among Saudi women from 22% to 30% and are actively seeking to recruit greater numbers of women into our company.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What kind of expertise can foreign investors like TAV bring into the Kingdom&rsquo;s airport operations sector?</strong></p>
<p>We believe that investing in another country is also about transferring corporate knowledge and culture to that country. As a global airport management company and part of Groupe ADP, TAV has refined a highly professional business model that we have brought to our Saudi operations through our service companies, which are providing a range of services including duty-free retail, food and beverage, ground handling, information technologies, lounge operations, and meet-and-greet services. All of these services employ integrated accounting, finance, and reporting systems to monitor all our operations globally.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, we provide our local Saudi talent with continuous training provided by experts our other operations to ensure that they understand our business model and embody our corporate culture. This is essential for increasing stakeholder satisfaction and enhancing our operations.</p> "

<p><strong>Full steam ahead</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><em>Partners in the evolution of trade</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the last 22 years, the story of MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company&rsquo;s (MSC) business in Saudi Arabia has been one of deepening ties, as the company&rsquo;s growth in the country has closely tracked the evolution of Saudi trade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Founded in 1970 and based in Geneva, Switzerland, MSC is the second-largest container shipping company in the world. The company runs 480 offices in 155 countries and employs over 70,000 people. Its 490 container vessels have an intake capacity of roughly 3.1m twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) and call at 500&nbsp;ports via 200 routes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MSC first began operating in the Kingdom on an agency basis in June 1996, and continued its activities as the country&rsquo;s trade balance grew through the first decade of the 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;century. While Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s total annual exports stood at just 0.6% of the world total in 1998, by 2011 this proportion had reached 1.6%, amounting to some $355bn. Although oil remained the largest source of trade income, it was also a period of great increases in non-oil exports, which rose from 1% of the country&rsquo;s total exports in the late 1970s to almost 14% in 2011. In 2018 the IMF forecasts non-oil exports will make up nearly 24% of total sales abroad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In late 2011, the same year that Saudi&rsquo;s trade balance reached an all-time high, MSC applied for SAGIA license and entered into a local partnership. Today MSC Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s operations in the Kingdom have 150 employees, spread across locations at King Abdullah Port (KAP), King Abdul Aziz Port in Dammam, Jubail Port and Riyadh Dry Port.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Committing to the port of the future</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fortunes of the company and those of the Kingdom&rsquo;s trading ports became more formally intertwined in October 2014, when the operations of the country&rsquo;s newest port, KAP at King Abdullah Economic City (KAEC), were handed over to National Container Terminal (NCT). NCT is a special purpose container facilities operator partially owned by Terminal Investment Limited, MSC&rsquo;s subsidiary for global terminal operations. KAP opened in the fourth quarter of 2013 and has since handled almost 4.9m TEUs in cumulative throughput. Annual throughput growth of 21% in 2017 saw KAP become the Kingdom&rsquo;s second-largest port, with 1.7m TEUs handled, and the world&rsquo;s eighth-fastest-growing port according to an April 2018 statement by Alphaliner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MSC has been quick to express its satisfaction with the port, which boasts more than 30 deepwater berths and direct, uninterrupted highway access day and night. Part of its advantage is down to its location on the Asia-Europe trunk line, which means it can reduce trans-shipment times by 5-7 days. Thanks to a program implemented in February 2017, by which a ship&rsquo;s manifest is uploaded five days before the vessel&rsquo;s arrival and the delivery order is released two days prior to docking, MSC is now able to clear its cargo at KAP within 24 hours. This delivers efficiency that equals the best ports in the world. Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s Vision 2030 long-term development plan targets the reduction of average Customs times across all Saudi ports from 14 days to 24 hours, while the National Transformation Program (NTP) sets an interim 2020 target of five days in-port time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MSC management say a lack of congestion is a further advantage of KAP, and plans are in place to forestall any future traffic issues by expanding port capacity. According to KAEC management, the port aims to keep pace with growth by expanding its capacity from 3m to 5m TEUs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Designed to be fully integrated with the country&rsquo;s expanding land, rail and air infrastructure, KAP is also the Kingdom&rsquo;s first privately owned and funded port. The process of privatizing Saudi ports has been ongoing for the past 20 years, with the Saudi Ports Authority entering into the third phase of its port privatization program in 2017. This third phase is expected to result in lower shipping costs and reduced container time at ports. The NTP targets 100% privatization of the Saudi Ports Authority by 2020.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>A hub for three continents</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>KAP is emblematic of the Kingdom&rsquo;s ambitions to become an international trading hub, as summarized in its Vision 2030 objective to &ldquo;establish a unique logistic platform across three continents&rdquo;. Thanks to a geographic location on the main Asia-Europe trunk line, and with the Gulf benefitting from increased traffic due to the continued strengthening of Chinese and Indian trade, logistics and trans-shipment play a key role in the government&rsquo;s strategy for economic diversification. As evidence of its progress in this area under Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia is targeting a substantial improvement in its ranking on the World Bank&rsquo;s Logistical Performance Index, which measures Customs, infrastructure and service quality, from 52<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;to 25<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;position by the end of the plan&rsquo;s period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To this end, the NTP 2020 outlined the allocation of $39.6m across various government agencies towards goals such as the professionalization of the logistics sector ($5.4m), the enhancement of import and export processes ($17.9m), the improvement of logistics regulations ($11m) and the establishment of a Global Logistics Centre ($5.3m).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vision 2030 also outlines investment in land, rail and air transport infrastructure, all of which will complement the appeal of the country&rsquo;s trade ports. These include the establishment of a Red Sea bridge to Egypt and a GCC railway network, while a proposed GCC Customs Union will strengthen cross-border trade in the region.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>A dynamic approach to Saudization</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In terms of its employment policy, in June 2017 MSC began implementing an 18-month program to localize its workforce in line with the government policies for Saudization outlined in Vision 2030. With new Saudis being employed every week, the company&rsquo;s documentation team is now entirely made up of Saudi employees, while the accountancy team is currently undergoing Saudization and expects to be fully staffed by nationals by the end of the year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given that there is not a tradition of shipping expertise within local labor markets, MSC&rsquo;s employment policy has been to seek out recent graduates or talents in related fields and train them according to specific needs. It has also taken a dynamic approach to increasing the number of female staff by seeking to employ two women for every man hired.</p>

<h3><strong>CEO Interview</strong></h3>
<p><em>Hisham Al Ansari, CEO of MSC Saudi Arabia</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What do you think of Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s potential as a trans-shipment and logistics hub?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely it has strong potential. The King Abdullah Port (KAP) on the Red Sea coast is operated with the purpose of becoming a trans-shipment and logistics hub for the region. We have based our services on connecting east to west and north to south via KAP. If you look at our operations there today, you can see that we can connect all the continents of the globe, taking in North America, Northern Europe, the Mediterranean, Africa, Australia, New Zealand and East Asia. We have direct services from all these places and we do hundreds of thousands of containers worth of trans-shipments at KAP every year. We also have live and hot connections, and offer a full range of trans-shipment methods at KAP. So while our intention for the future is to have more shipping lines coming into KAP offering more services and in greater numbers, much of the work has already been achieved at the port.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In terms of the country&rsquo;s potential as a logistics hub, geographically it is very well placed between East and West. There are a lot of ideas in the pipeline in terms of transforming Saudi Arabia into a logistics hub. More and more opportunities are opening up in areas like distribution, directed deliveries, international land connections, and so on. KAP and the various new economic zones are all part of this bigger picture. It is an ambitious program that will create a lot of opportunities for investment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What sort of evolution have you seen in terms of trade passing through Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s ports?</strong></p>
<p>The East in general and China in particular is a really dynamic trade partner for the Kingdom. Then there is India, which is growing ever-stronger trade ties. Trade between Saudi Arabia and South America is trending upward: we are now bringing in huge amounts of cargo from places like Brazil, Argentina, Ecuador, Colombia and Costa Rica. South-east Asian markets are also coming up. We&rsquo;re trading with places like Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Myanmar, in some cases for the first time. The Kingdom&rsquo;s trade map is definitely dynamic at present.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>To what extent is Saudi Arabia still predominately an inbound market?</strong></p>
<p>You might be surprised to know that Saudi Arabia has also become a very strong exporter. Things are going extremely well in terms of exports, with numbers increasing month-on-month. Global export numbers are rising dramatically. Today at KAP, Dammam and Jubail we have a shortage of containers for export. The Kingdom exports a whole range of products, including petrochemicals, glass, household items, chemicals, furniture, flowers, vegetables, oil, aluminum, dates and foodstuffs. Exports are growing in almost all areas. One of my favorite examples is that we are now exporting flowers from Taif region in Saudi Arabia to Holland, which you could definitely not have imagined in the past. Our ships are full and there is more demand than we can provide ships for. So to reply to your question, the days when Saudi Arabia was predominantly just an import country are over.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What improvements are being made in terms of Customs procedures in Saudi Arabia?</strong></p>
<p>The Saudi Customs authorities have been working on a Customs modernization program since February 2017. At MSC we have shown from day one that we are ready to play a part in this initiative. As part of the Vision 2030, the Saudi Customs program aims to reduce the clearance of goods to 24 hours. We have been working on it since March 2017. It has been quite successful in KAP, particularly because in KAP we don&rsquo;t have very high levels of congestion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The government has a vision of facilitating business for importers and exporters, and it is coming true. Over the years, Customs has changed quite dramatically in terms of making life easier for people and companies. Today we can clear goods in 24 hours at KAP, which would not have been possible a few years ago.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>What opportunities do you see for prospective investors?</strong></p>
<p>There has been a lot of investment in Saudi Arabia in terms of traditional businesses. I&rsquo;m talking about everything from carpet manufacturing to real estate to petrochemicals and energy. But logistics has not been a strong area of focus for the private sector, especially in terms of logistics that goes beyond third-party logistics and builds technology into the platform itself. I think this is an area where the market is still very raw and has a lot of potential for growth. Most importantly, logistics hubs are being promoted by the government as part of Vision 2030, providing added benefits and incentives for investors.</p> "

<p style='font-size: 13px;'>Over the past couple of decades, one the main challenges that the technology sector has faced globally relates to bridging the IT skills gap. The pace of technological advancements and disruptions has continuously left companies with the need to update their employees with the latest IT knowledge. Similarly, education institutions are constantly pressured to keep their IT curricula in line with the latest needs of the labor market. Cisco&rsquo;s investment in Saudi Arabia presents an interesting case of how a multinational company has successfully partnered with government institutions to address this challenge and secure the human capital required to fuel the needs of businesses and organizations in the digital era.</p>
<p style='font-size: 13px;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='font-size: 13px;'>Cisco is the world's largest networking company, with more than a 50% share of the total worldwide switching and router market. It is estimated that over 80% of the world&rsquo;s internet traffic running on Cisco&rsquo;s networks. The company entered the Saudi market just thirteen years after it was established in the US in 1984. Since that time, Cisco's relationship with the Kingdom has evolved from being a provider of hardware and product services to become a government partner and a trusted advisor in the fields of technology education and training, cyber security, as well as IT and telecommunications infrastructure and the digital transformation of healthcare, among other sectors.</p>
<p style='font-size: 13px;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='font-size: 13px;'>When Cisco came to Saudi Arabia in 1997, the Kingdom&rsquo;s IT infrastructure development was in its very early stages. At the time, Saudi Arabia had a fixed telephone penetration of 9.8% compared to 63.3% in the US. Mobile cellular subscriptions stood at 1.7% in Saudi Arabia and 20.1% in the US. IT was a quickly evolving field, and what students learned during their education often became outdated by the time they graduated and began to seek employment. Therefore, the biggest challenge Cisco faced when entering the Saudi market as a thirteen-year-old company was the mismatch between the certifications and qualifications being offered in local education and the needs of employers.</p>
<p style='font-size: 13px;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='font-size: 13px;'>In that vein, the challenge of finding human resources with the required IT skills did not just lie in the technology sector. Cisco traditionally outsources many of its non-core needs such as logistics, human resources and finance. Coming in the early days with a nascent Saudi ecosystem, these human capital needs were also scarcely met by the market, especially on the tech-integrated level that Cisco's operations demanded.</p>
<p style='font-size: 13px;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='font-size: 13px;'><em>Partnering with the government to </em><em>build the workforce of tomorrow</em></p>
<p style='font-size: 13px;'><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style='font-size: 13px;'>To address this skills gap, Cisco began to expand its scope from being a provider of products, services and technology solutions to one of training and human capital development as well. In 2006, John Chambers, Cisco's former Executive Chairman and CEO, came to the Kingdom at a time when the country had started to increase its focus on developing its ICT infrastructure and capabilities. Interestingly, Saudi Arabia had surpassed the US in terms of mobile penetration, with a rate of 77.6% compared to 76.3% in the US, although Internet usage had at the time reached 68.9% in the US, but still stood at 19.5% in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p style='font-size: 13px;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='font-size: 13px;'>Chambers signed a memorandum of understanding with the governor of the Technical and Vocational Training Corporation (TVTC) to embed Cisco&rsquo;s Networking Academy courses into TVTC's computer science academic program. TVTC is a government training institute that links Saudi vocational students with employers who have employment opportunities but insufficient technical talent, with branches in all major Saudi cities.</p>
<p style='font-size: 13px;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='font-size: 13px;'>With a &ldquo;train the trainer&rdquo; model, Cisco brought their training programs to TVTC and other partners, therefore gaining access to a larger number of Saudi students than the company could reach alone. Since launching this program, Cisco has had almost 100,000 students graduate from the program, creating a huge pool of talented Saudis for all employers in the technology ecosystem, and beyond.</p>
<p style='font-size: 13px;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='font-size: 13px;'>In parallel, Cisco invested in its in-house training capabilities. Since 2005 Cisco has had associate programs where they send employees to Europe for training, and since 2009 they have run internship programs designed for Saudi IT students. In the Kingdom, Cisco also started to apply the on-the-job training and shadowing strategy that is applied in Cisco globally.</p>
<p style='font-size: 13px;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='font-size: 13px;'>To encourage diversity and address the gender divide that affects the tech sector internationally, Cisco has also launched several initiatives for training female Saudis. In 2010-11 Cisco Saudi Arabia had one of the highest percentages of female employment across all of their emerging markets branches.</p>
<p style='font-size: 13px;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='font-size: 13px;'><em>A sea of talent</em></p>
<p style='font-size: 13px;'><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style='font-size: 13px;'>Currently, Cisco boasts a Saudiization rate higher than industry average and is able to flexibly hire and train new resources in line with the projects and customer demand. At its highest, the company achieved nearly 60% Saudiization in 2015 when the ICT sector overall rate stood at 50%.</p>
<p style='font-size: 13px;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='font-size: 13px;'>Their experience stresses the importance of having a long-term vision and commitment to the local economy which enables viewing training as an investment rather than a cost. Saudi employees see the value in coming to work with a reputable international company, while the offering of training and professional development facilitates retention and reduces staff turnover.</p>
<p style='font-size: 13px;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='font-size: 13px;'>Today Saudi Arabia is one of just 15 countries that Cisco has chosen for its Country Digitisation Acceleration (CDA) programme, a global initiative with the breadth and scope to drive economic growth and create next-generation jobs through digital adoption at a country level. The CDA program is a long-term partnership with national leadership, industry and academia to help set the agenda for countries with deep commitment to digitisation. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's philanthropic organisation dedicated to the development of Saudi youth, MiSK, has raised digitisation awareness by advocating for the importance of learning to code.</p>
<p style='font-size: 13px;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='font-size: 13px;'>The government drive is based firmly on job creation and an understanding of the economic impact tech skills can have. During the Crown Prince's visit to Silicon Valley in 2016, agreements were signed between several Saudi organizations and US tech companies including Cisco to develop digital infrastructure in the Kingdom. As a result, the company is currently working with the government on digital transformation projects in the fields of healthcare, education and smart cities.</p>
<p style='font-size: 13px;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='font-size: 13px;'><em>The framework for the future</em></p>
<p style='font-size: 13px;'><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style='font-size: 13px;'>Saudi Arabia is a very different country than the one that Cisco entered in 1997 and John Chambers visited in 2006. In 2016 internet penetration was at 74% in Saudi Arabia and 76% in the US, with Saudis ranking among the world&rsquo;s most active users of social media. Among other targets, the Kingdom&rsquo;s Vision 2030 aims to take internet usage to the next level and achieve 85% active users by 2020.</p>
<p style='font-size: 13px;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='font-size: 13px;'>In terms of education and training, Vision 2030 features a number of initiatives aimed at bridging the skills gap that companies like Cisco have long been working on. The Vision pledges to &ldquo;offer preparation and training to those unable to find employment so they can smoothly join the workforce whenever possible,&rdquo; and to &ldquo;redouble efforts to ensure that the outcomes of our education system are in line with market needs&rdquo;. This includes the launch of the National Labor Gateway (TAQAT), a labor gateway already soft-launched that connects private- and public-sector employers with employees who match their needs, offering services to both and facilitating training throughout employees' careers. The Vision also mentions a focus on advanced technologies and entrepreneurship as top priorities for training.</p>
<p style='font-size: 13px;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='font-size: 13px;'>Under the National Transformation Program (NTP), the first executive program of Saudi Vision 2030 with specific goals established for achievement by 2020, the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MCIT) has pledged a $3.9bn budget from the government to carry out various reforms and training initiatives. The launch and activation of ICT training centers in partnership with major of ICT companies will itself receive a budget of $8.9m. The MCIT targets to rehabilitate and employ 20,000 Saudi cadres in the ICT sector by 2020.</p>
<p style='font-size: 13px;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='font-size: 13px;'>Under other ministries, $2.3m will be spent to activate a career training program for graduates and job seekers in ICT companies, in addition to other spending on vocational training colleges and a national program for e-training of government employees among many other training initiatives. While 7% of high school graduates then go through TVTC's training programs outlined above, this proportion is targeted to be 12.5% by 2020.</p>
<p style='font-size: 13px;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='font-size: 13px;'>In a promising move for the future of the ICT sector, Abdullah Alswaha was appointed the Minister of Communications and Information Technology in April 2017, after twelve years as the Managing Director of Cisco Saudi Arabia. The move was lauded as one of many signs in the last two years that the top leadership of the country will continue to put a greater priority on technology and the immense potential it has on positively impacting society and the economy.</p>"

<p style='font-size: 15px;'><strong>SAGIA Investor Case Study: Hewlett-Packard Enterprise</strong></p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'><strong>A revamped local presence</strong></p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'><em>Running start</em></p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>Over the past few decades Saudi Arabia has proved to be an important market for multinational corporations, especially in the ICT field. As a G20 economy with a young and rapidly growing population, the Kingdom is a strategic priority for many international players, including Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE). HPE entered the country in 2001 (as HP, before the company split in 2015) and invested in the Kingdom as Saudi Arabia has progressed technologically and otherwise.</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>In turn, Saudi Arabia directly benefitted of the presence of international companies such as HPE. Apart from the direct beneficial effects of foreign investment, HPE’s presence is Saudi Arabia has provided with direct access to the latest technological expertise and solutions developed globally. As Saudi Arabia embarks on a path towards the goals set out by Vision 2030, the importance of technology and digitization has become increasingly apparent.</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>The National Digital Transformation Initiative under the National Transformation Program, an implementation plan for Vision 2030, aims to transform the Kingdom from a consumer to a producer of technology solutions.&nbsp; Coming as one of the first companies in Silicon Valley, still the global powerhouse of technology innovation, HPE brings technology know-how and experience. Most importantly, however, HPE’s relation with Saudi Arabia reached a turning point in 2017 when the company shifted from being an ICT solutions supplier to an ICT foreign investor, aligning its local presence with Saudi Arabia's market needs.</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'><em>Locally built</em></p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>HPE entered the market as many foreign companies do, forming partnerships with vendors through which its products are marketed and sold. This is a highly regarded way to do business in a market like Saudi Arabia, where local partners forge business relationships with multinational companies by bringing their knowledge to the table. However, following the visit in May 2017 by Meg Withman, HPE’s former chief executive, the company initiated the process to become a SAGIA-licensed foreign investor in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>The move is intended to benefit from the efficiency gains of doing business independently in the country. Looking at the Saudi customer experience from placing the order to making the payment, HPE found that most the time spent in order processing could be eliminated by reducing the documentation and the number of procedures required, benefits that could come from registering as a direct investor in the Kingdom.</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>Direct investors to the Kingdom are subject to a 20% corporate income tax. HPE evaluated this tax regime as competitive relative to the rest of the world and worth the business development autonomy that would come with the foreign investor status. As a result of this move, the company was increasingly able invest in talent development and provide a full range of ICT development functions that go beyond the already provided support services.</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'><em>Trained for success</em></p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>Among the new functions introduced, HPE established a training program that supports the company in meeting the workforce development requirements of a growing market like Saudi Arabia. Currently HPE has a cohort of 24 graduates, 50% of whom graduated from the King Abdullah Scholarship Program, a government program launched in 2005 to financially support Saudi students at leading universities abroad.</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>HPE’s new hires are required to attend a three-month training class, followed by two years of on-the-job training rotations. The class includes technology and soft skills and takes place completely in English so that Saudi graduates can cement their familiarity with the technical vocabulary used in the industry and within the company. HPE is currently running the seventh round of this program after having promoted several graduates to positions across the different departments within the company.</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>According to the company, by revamping its Saudi Arabia’s office structure HPE managed to reduce bureaucratic processes that took more than a month to an average of two weeks. The re-structuring also allowed HPE to address some of the challenges traditionally experienced with importing technology due to trade restrictions, delays bringing in new products through Customs or other logistics challenges. Products had to pass through many hubs before being brought into the country. To address this, HPE worked to become an importer of record with Saudi Customs. This moved allowed the company to improve the import process and shorten wait times.</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'><em>Expanding scope</em></p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>Free to provide its Saudi customers with more than just sales services, HPE also added advisory and business consultancy services to its local portfolio, by establishing its digital transformation services provided by Pointnext organization. Saudi Arabia is one of nineteen countries where consultancy and professional services are currently provided. At the global level, Pointnext’s advisory services are offered to governments to enable a clear technology strategy and digital transformation roadmap. This is often considered a fertile soil to introduce HPE’s comprehensive multi-vendor technology solutions and build around the national digital initiatives.</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>Digital transformation services are also targeting the Saudi corporate market, where the convergence between information technology, infrastructure, digital platforms, social media and communications is even more apparent. Companies in Saudi Arabia and beyond require new services as they race to maintain relevance in an increasingly digital world. In this context, demand for ICT consulting services, such as enterprise architecture and change management, is expected in increase in the near future.</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>The introduction of these services in the Saudi market is also aligned with the goals set by the Saudi Vision 2030. In this context, the government aim to improve Saudi Arabia’s position in the World Bank's Government Effectiveness Index from 80th to 20th by 2030. Furthermore, Vision 2030 aims to increase the small and medium enterprise contribution to the Kingdom's GDP from 20% to 35%. Both targets rely heavily on process engineering and efficiency improvements. With the aid of well-implemented and state-of-the-art technology solutions, Saudi Arabia could have an opportunity to leapfrog developed countries into the digital future.</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>ICT solution and digital transformation services companies are expected to play an important role as the government works to leverage the Kingdom's young population to improve the use of technology throughout government and private sector organizations. HPE’s revamped presence in Saudi Arabia provides a good example of how the transfer of foreign expertise and training capacity can provide foreign investors with a unique position to benefit from such a dynamic and growing digital market.</p>

<h3 style='text-align: center;'><strong>CEO Interview </strong></h3>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'><em>Mohammed Al Jasser, Managing Director of Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Saudi Arabia</em></p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'><strong>What drove HPE to transform its Saudi presence and register as a foreign direct investor?</strong></p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>As we were reviewing the flow of goods, the order-to-cash process, we increasingly realised that obtaining a local license could increase our efficiency, shorten delivery cycles, ease documentation processing, and achieve some savings on operational expenditure. Based on a thorough internal analysis, we found that the end-to-end customer experience would immensely improve. Therefore, it really became a no-brainer to make that decision.</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>When the proper comparative analysis is done across the two scenarios, we are seeing a significant improvement right from the start, in addition to increased flexibility for the future. As a sales office, it would be more challenging to maintain a sustainable business model in the long term, with staffing requirements playing a big part in this respect. As a matter of fact, beyond the operational efficiency, being a direct investor in the Kingdom enables us to develop local talent and create a more sustainable local presence.</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px;'>It was the easiest process of this kind my team has ever gone through in any country. It was smooth and organized. We were able to communicate back-and-forth with SAGIA to get proper and prompt feedback, making the process as easy as we could imagine.</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>SAGIA in particular has proved extremely eager to hear our concerns. They work by the book but also agree to look at the challenges that multinational investors faces in terms of government bureaucracy on a partnership basis. SAGIA went above and beyond our expectations by assigning a dedicated person who would follow up on our case. They would even proactively call to check on our legal team’s requirements and would offer to review our draft documents before formal submission to avoid wasting time with any missing stamps or other details. SAGIA made it clear that they are mandated to be the investors’ representative within the government and, in our case, they proved to be good ambassadors in the public sector ecosystem.</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>It took just a few weeks of documents preparation from the day HPE finalized the decision to register locally to the day we formally applied. Most of that time was dedicated to the preparation and translation of internal documents, as well as approvals by our legal, finance and other departments around the globe. In terms of timing, SAGIA kept to their promise by issuing the licence within 48 hours, a dramatic transformation for our presence in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>As one of the first fifty companies to obtain this investor licence, the speed and quality of HPE’s licensing procedure is an absolute accomplishment for SAGIA and a testimony of the Saudi government’s overall improvement. Such as smooth process would have been unthinkable just three years ago and the Kingdom has come such a long way in a very short period. As a technology company, we were particularly impressed by the fact that all procedures were executed digitally, with the ability to track procedural steps online and no need for physical bureaucratic interactions.</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'><strong>How would you rate Saudi businesses' adoption of the latest technology?</strong></p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>Our decision to get a local license was influenced by the decision to play a part in the country's digital transformation, developing the Kingdom’s technology roadmap and looking at how we can help execute on that. HPE itself went under a big corporate transformation in the last few years and has a wealth of knowledge on how to guide others in using technologies to map out new solutions. At a global level, HPE has an advisory and business consulting arm that has only been activated in 19 countries to accelerate their digital transformation. One of them is Saudi Arabia; that shows HPE’s commitment towards the country.</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>We have already introduced our newest products that serve these needs, and Saudi Arabia is definitely a promising market for them. For instance, we are implementing in Saudi Arabia and few other countries the Cloud 28+ digital platform for B2B collaborations. This is a platform that allows for lead generation, media communication and other collaboration opportunities between companies. Moreover, we are introducing Pathfinder, a program that brings HPE’s venture investment and partnership to top-tier start-ups in their expansion phase, a critical need for Saudi companies as they try to expand beyond their local and regional markets. We are constantly looking at potential investments in the Kingdom that will integrate well with our business.</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>In addition, we anticipate more government support for SMEs in the form of tax breaks or other incentives that encourage them to invest in technology as the Kingdom pushes forward in its drive to increase automation and jump to the front of Industry 4.0 trends.</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'><strong>What has been your experience with training Saudi employees?</strong></p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>When the right environment is created and local professionals are given the right chance, they will succeed. Our trainees start as full-time employees, they see our company's dedication to the country and willingness to invest in their abilities. That makes a big difference. With our newest round of hiring, we have already seen some return on our investment as they are creating leads and on-boarding new partners in their few months at the company. We welcome anyone to come learn from our training program and facilities and invite them to replicate our model as we work to better develop the technology ecosystem in the Kingdom.</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'><strong>What will be the role of technological consultancy in the Kingdom's transformation?</strong></p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>We can see the global convergence between IT, communications, media and government taking place in Saudi Arabia at every level. At individual level, the high penetration of Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram and so on is allowing any Saudi to be a media producer. This has huge implications for the sector’s infrastructure needs. For businesses and government entities, we need to distinguish between digitization and digital transformation. Digitization is basically taking an existing process and making it digital, without changes.</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>In digital transformation, you are actually disrupting the true essence of the process and changing the end-to-end experience, whether that is in making a new process, taking steps out of the process, or otherwise making things easier, faster and cheaper to do. We need to answer many questions, such as: What can you do to improve the customer experience? What goals do you want to achieve that will require process re-engineering? That is a transformation that requires enterprise change management and consulting to develop a business strategy and then a digital transformation strategy. Once we set clear business objectives, we can look at how technology can help. Technology should only be the means to an end business objective, improving the customer or citizen experience; in order to be successful, we need to have the business strategy and the technology strategy aligned and designed together. These are the issues Saudi Arabia and the world are currently confronted with.</p>"
