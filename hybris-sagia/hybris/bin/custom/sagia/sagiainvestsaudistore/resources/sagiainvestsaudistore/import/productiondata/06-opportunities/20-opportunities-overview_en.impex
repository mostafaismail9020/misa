<p>This opportunity entails localizing the value chain of open-die forging to serve KSA and GCC energy sectors.</p>
<p>Open-die forging is one of five metal techniques (investment casting, sand casting, closed-die forging and rolled-ring forging) used to manufacture energy products in KSA.</p>
<p>In KSA, open-die forging is driven by turbines (Pelton, Turgo and Crossflow), electric motors (single phase and three pase AC), wellhead equipment (casing head and spools), pumps (positive displacement, impulse, velocity, gravity, steam and valve-less pumps), ball valves (single, three-piece, split, top entry and welded), gas compressors (positive displacement-reciprocating, rotary dynamic-centrifugal and axial) &amp; blowout preventers (annular and ram).</p>
<p>In 2016, KSA demand for open-die forging was valued at USD 304 Mn (32% of all five techniques used to manufacture energy products) and estimated to be 47 Ktpa (20% of all five techniques used to manufacture energy products) broken down by the following categories: Ball valves: 13 Ktpa, Wellhead equipment: 11.2 Ktpa, Electric motors: 7.4 Ktpa, Turbines: 6.4 Ktpa, Pumps: 3.8 Ktpa, Blowout preventers (ram): 2.7 Ktpa, Blowout preventers (annular): 1.6 Ktpa and Compressor (gas): 1.3 Ktpa</p>
<p>Demand for open-die forging in KSA is forecasted to increase at an annual growth rate of 3% to reach 62 Ktpa by 2025.</p>
<p>Beyond the KSA market, investors in Saudi Arabia have the opportunity to tap into the large regional market in the GCC which is expected to witness strong growth fueled by oil and gas production (expected to increase from 44 Ktpa in 2017 to 56 Ktpa by 2025).</p>
<p>The increase in demand for closed-die forging and the limited presence of local players coupled with the Governments push for localization presents a great opportunity for the private sector to invest in establishing state-of-the-art forging facilities (including next generation forging).</p>
<p>Beyond forging facilities for closed-die forging, other opportunities exist&nbsp; across the value chain including:</p>

<p>Closed-die forging is one of five metal techniques (investment casting, sand casting, open-die forging and rolled-ring forging) used to manufacture energy products in KSA.</p>
<p>In KSA, closed-die forging is driven by turbines (Pelton, Turgo and Crossflow), vales (ball, check and gate), wellhead equipment (casing head and spools), gas compressors (positive displacement-reciprocating, rotary dynamic-centrifugal and axial), blowout preventers (ram and annular), flanges (carbon steels and stainless steel flanges) and gears (spur, helical, bevel, worm, Herringbone and rack &amp; pinion).</p>
<p>In 2016, KSA demand for closed-die forging was valued at USD 179 Mn (17% of all five techniques used to manufacture energy products) and estimated to be 48 Ktpa (20% of all five techniques used to manufacture energy products) broken down by the following categories: flanges: 20.9 ktpa, ball valves: 6.0 ktpa, gate valves: 5.4 ktpa, turbines: 6.4 ktpa, wellhead equipment: 3.2 ktpa, gears: 2.7 ktpa, check valves: 1.6 ktpa, gas compressors: 0.8 ktpa, blowout preventers (ram): 0.7 ktpa and blowout preventers (annular): 0.4 ktpa.</p>

<p>In 2016, KSA demand for sand casting was valued at USD 178 Mn (18.5% of all five techniques used to manufacture energy products) and estimated to be 58 Ktpa (24% of all five techniques used to manufacture energy products) broken down by the following categories: gate valves: 20.1 ktpa, butterfly valves: 12.4 ktpa, ball valves: 8.7 ktpa, globe valves: 7.3 ktpa, check valves: 6.6 ktpa and pumps: 2.8 ktpa.</p>
<p>Demand for sand castings in KSA is forecasted to increase at an annual growth rate of 3% to reach 87 ktpa.</p>
<p>Beyond the KSA market, investors in Saudi Arabia have the opportunity to tap into the large regional market in the GCC which is expected to witness strong growth fueled by oil and gas production (expected to increase from 54 ktpa in 2017 to 79 Ktpa by 2030).</p>
<p>The increase in demand for sand casting and the limited presence of local players coupled with the Governments push for localization presents a great opportunity for the private sector to invest in establishing manufacturing sand casting plants to serve the KSA and GCC energy sectors.</p>
<p>Beyond manufacturing plants for sand casting, other opportunities exist across the value chain including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establishing manufacturing plants for investment casting molds, leveraging the presence of ceramic and binders in Saudi Arabia</li>
<li>Developing production plants for steel billet and ingots at high scale</li>

<p>This opportunity entails developing the value chain for the Aluminium downstream business.</p>
<p>Forging is a manufacturing process in which metal is pressed, pounded, or squeezed under great pressure into high-strength parts. This is usually done by heating the metal, but some forgings are produced without heat. Generally, forged components are shaped by either a hammer or a press. Forging by hammer is carried out in a succession of die impressions using repeated blows. In a press, the component is usually hit only once in each die impression.</p>
<p>The three basic types of aluminum alloy forgings are open-die forgings, closed-die forgings, and rolled rings.</p>
<p>In automotive applications, forged components are commonly found at points of shock and stress. Forged automobile components include connecting rods, crankshafts, wheel spindles, axle beams, pistons, gears, and steering arms.</p>
<p>Forgings are also used in helicopters, piston-engine planes, commercial jets, and supersonic military aircraft. Many aircraft are &ldquo;designed around&rdquo; forgings and contain more than 450 structural forgings, including hundreds of forged engine parts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forged&rdquo; is the mark of quality in hand tools and hardware. Pliers, hammers, sledgers, wrenches, garden implements, and surgical tools are always produced through forging.</p>
